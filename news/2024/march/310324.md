- **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) clarifies use of tracking tech by HIPAA Covered Entities** (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/hipaa-online-tracking/index.html): NB: A court vacated the guidance to the extent it provides that HIPAA obligations are triggered in “circumstances where an online technology connects (1) an individual’s IP address with (2) a visit to a[n] [unauthenticated public webpage] addressing specific health conditions or healthcare providers.
  - **What is a tracking technology?** Script or code on a website or mobile app used to gather information about users or their actions as they interact with a website or mobile app. After information is collected through tracking technologies from websites or mobile apps, it is then analyzed by owners of the website or mobile app (“website owner” or “mobile app owner”), or third parties, to create insights about users’ online activities. Websites commonly use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons or tracking pixels, session replay scripts, and fingerprinting scripts to track and collect information from users. Mobile apps generally include/embed tracking code within the app to enable the app to collect information directly provided by the user, and apps may also capture the user’s mobile device-related information.
  - **How do the HIPAA Rules apply to regulated entities’ use of tracking technologies?** Some regulated entities may be disclosing a variety of information to tracking technology vendors through tracking technologies placed on the regulated entity’s website or mobile app, such as information that the individual types or selects when they use regulated entities’ websites or mobile apps. The information disclosed might include an individual’s medical record number, home or email address, or dates of appointments, as well as an individual’s IP address or geographic location, device IDs, or any unique identifying code. In some cases, the information disclosed may meet the definition of individually identifiable health information (IIHI). 
    - !!! The **mere fact that an online tracking technology connects the IP address** of a user’s device (or other identifying information) **with a visit to a webpage addressing specific health conditions** or listing health care providers **is not a sufficient combination of information to constitute IIHI if the visit to the webpage is not related to an individual’s past, present, or future health, health care, or payment** for health care.
    - **Tracking on user-authenticated webpages**: Tracking technologies on a regulated entity’s user-authenticated webpages generally have access to PHI. Such PHI may include, for example, an individual’s IP address, medical record number, home or email addresses, dates of appointments, or other identifying information that the individual may provide when interacting with the webpage. Tracking technologies within user-authenticated webpages may even have access to an individual’s diagnosis and treatment information, prescription information, billing information, or other information within the portal. Therefore, a regulated entity must configure any user-authenticated webpages that include tracking technologies to allow such technologies to only use and disclose PHI in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
    - **Tracking on unauthenticated webpages**: Tracking technologies on many unauthenticated webpages do not have access to individuals’ PHI; in this case, a regulated entity’s use of such tracking technologies is not regulated by the HIPAA Rules.
      - For example, where a user merely visits a hospital’s webpage that provides information about the hospital’s job postings or visiting hours, the collection and transmission of information showing such a visit to the webpage, along with the user’s IP address, geographic location, or other identifying information showing their visit to that webpage, would not involve a disclosure of an individual’s PHI to  tracking technology vendor.
      - For example, if a student were writing a term paper on the changes in the availability of oncology services before and after the COVID-19 public health emergency, the collection and transmission of information showing that the student visited a hospital’s webpage listing the oncology services provided by the hospital would not constitute a disclosure of PHI, even if the information could be used to identify the student.
      - For example, tracking technologies might collect an individual’s email address, or reason for seeking health care typed or selected by an individual, when the individual visits a regulated entity’s webpage and makes an appointment with a health care provider or enters symptoms in an online tool to obtain a health analysis. In this example, the regulated entity is disclosing PHI to the tracking technology vendor, and **thus the HIPAA Rules apply**. 
    - **Tracking within mobile apps**: Mobile apps that regulated entities offer to individuals (e.g., to help manage their health information, pay bills) collect a variety of information provided by the app user, including information typed or uploaded into the app, as well as information provided by the app user’s device, such as fingerprints,32 network location, geolocation, device ID, or advertising ID. Such information collected by a regulated entity’s mobile app generally is PHI and the regulated entity must comply with the HIPAA Rules for any PHI that the mobile app uses or discloses, including any subsequent disclosures to the mobile app vendor, tracking technology vendor, or any other third party who receives such information.
  - **HIPAA compliance obligations for regulated entities when using tracking technologies**:
    - Ensuring that all disclosures of PHI to tracking technology vendors are specifically permitted by the Privacy Rule
      - the Privacy Rule does not permit disclosures of PHI to a tracking technology vendor based solely on a regulated entity informing individuals in its privacy policy, notice, or terms and conditions of use that it plans to make such disclosures. Regulated entities must ensure that all tracking technology vendors have signed a BAA and that there is an applicable permission prior to a disclosure of PHI;
      - Website banners that ask users to accept or reject a website’s use of tracking technologies, such as cookies, do not constitute a valid HIPAA authorization.
    - Establishing a BAA with a tracking technology vendor that meets the definition of a “business associate.”
    - Addressing the use of tracking technologies in the regulated entity’s Risk Analysis and Risk Management processes
    - Providing breach notification to affected individuals

- **CJEU rules on matters of personal data definition and joint controllership of IAB Europe (TCF operator)** (https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-03/cp240044en.pdf, https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=283529&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=14676550):
  - Background: 
    - **IAB**: IAB Europe is a non-profit association established in Belgium which represents undertakings in the digital advertising and marketing sector at European level. IAB Europe has drawn up the Transparency & Consent Framework (*‘the TCF’*). The TCF is aimed, inter alia, at promoting compliance with the GDPR when those operators use the OpenRTB protocol, one of the most widely used protocols for Real Time Bidding, which is an instant and automated online auction system of user profiles for the purpose of selling and purchasing advertising space on the internet (*‘RTB’*). In the light of certain practices implemented by members of IAB Europe in the context of that mass personal data exchange system relating to user profiles, the TCF was presented by IAB Europe as a solution capable of bringing that auction system into conformity with the GDPR.
    - **RTB**: 
      - From a technical point of view, when a user consults a website or application containing advertising space, advertising technology companies – particularly data brokers and advertising platforms, which represent thousands of advertisers – can bid in real time, behind the scenes, to acquire that advertising space by means of an automated auction system using algorithms, in order to display in that space targeted advertisements specifically tailored to the profile of such a user. 
      - Before displaying such targeted advertisements, the prior consent of that user must be obtained. Thus, when he or she consults a website or application for the first time, a Consent Management Platform (*‘CMP’*) appears in a pop-up window enabling that user, first, to give his or her consent to the provider of the website or application for the collection and processing of his or her personal data for pre-defined purposes, such as, inter alia, marketing or advertising, or with a view to sharing those data with certain providers, and, second, to object to various types of data processing or to the sharing of those data, based on legitimate interests claimed by providers, within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Those personal data relate, inter alia, to the user’s location, age and search and recent purchase history.
      - In that context, the TCF provides a framework for large-scale processing of personal data and facilitates the recording of users’ preferences by means of the CMP. Those preferences are subsequently encoded and stored in a string composed of a combination of letters and characters referred to by IAB Europe as the Transparency and Consent String (*‘the TC String’*), which is shared with personal data brokers and advertising platforms participating in the OpenRTB protocol, so that they know to what the user has consented or objected. The CMP also places a cookie (euconsent-v2) on the user’s device. When they are combined, the TC String and the euconsent-v2 cookie can be linked to that user’s IP address.
  - Judgement:
    - Personal data:
      - Q: Does a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String, containing the preferences of a user of the internet or of an application relating to that user’s consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her by website or application providers as well as by brokers of such data and by advertising platforms, constitute personal data?
      - A: It does, in so far as, where those data may, by reasonable means, be associated with an identifier, such as, inter alia, the IP address of that user’s device, they allow the data subject to be identified. In such circumstances, the fact that, without an external contribution, a sectoral organisation holding that string can neither access the data that are processed by its members under the rules which that organisation has established nor combine that string with other factors does not preclude that string from constituting personal data within the meaning of that provision. The deciding factor for such data to be considered "personal" was that the members of IAB Europe are required to provide that organisation, at its request, with all the information allowing it to identify the users whose data are the subject of a TC String.
    - Joint controllership:
      - Q1: Is IAB a joint controller in so far as it proposes to its members a framework of rules that it has established relating to consent to the processing of personal data, which contains not only binding technical rules but also rules setting out in detail the arrangements for storing and disseminating personal data relating to such consent?
      - A1: IAB Europe exerts influence over the processing of personal data, such as the TC String, for its own purposes, and determines, jointly with others, the purposes and means of such processing. It is apparent from the documents before the Court that, as has been noted in paragraphs 21 and 22 above, the TCF established by IAB Europe constitutes a framework of rules intended to ensure that the processing of personal data of a user of a website or application carried out by certain operators which participate in the online auctioning of advertising space is in compliance with the GDPR.
      - Q2: Is IAB a joint controller for subsequent processing?
      - A2: A distinction must be drawn between the processing of personal data carried out by the members of IAB Europe, namely website or application providers and data brokers or advertising platforms, when the consent preferences of the users concerned are recorded in a TC String in accordance with the framework of rules established in the TCF, on the one hand, and the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by those operators and by third parties on the basis of those preferences, such as the transmission of those data to third parties or the offering of personalised advertising to those users, on the other. That subsequent processing, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, does not appear to involve the participation of IAB Europe, with the result that automatic responsibility on the part of such an organisation, held jointly with the abovementioned operators and with third parties, must be precluded in respect of the processing of personal data carried out on the basis of data relating to the preferences of the users concerned contained in a TC String.

- **Collection of excessive data and excessive storage periods lead to EUR 856k fine in Finland** (https://tietosuoja.fi/-/verkkokauppa.comille-seuraamusmaksu-asiakastietojen-sailytysajan-maarittelematta-jattamisesta-myos-vaatimus-asiakkaan-rekisteroitymisesta-oli-lainvastainen): Verkkokauppa.com had required that the person register as a customer for making an online purchase. It was not possible to do business in the online store without creating a customer account. The data protection officer found that Verkkokauppa.com has kept customer account information for an indefinite period of time. According to Verkkokauppa.com, the retention period of data is determined by the customer, as the customer may request the closure of their account and the deletion of data if they wish. Due to the operating method, data on a single purchase may have been stored for a very long time. The data protection officer considers that Verkkokauppa.com violated the general data protection regulation by making online purchases a customer account a prerequisite. Making individual online purchases does not require the creation of a customer account or the storage of personal data to which the policy leads.

- **CNIL clarifies rules that a button for consent and hyperlink for rejection create invalid legal basis** (https://web.archive.org/web/20240308192222/https://www.cnil.fr/en/commercial-prospecting-foriou-fined-eu310000): FORIOU carries out phone prospecting campaigns in order to promote the loyalty programs and cards it markets. Data of solicited prospects are purchased by the company from data brokers and publishers of competition and product testing websites. CNIL regarded that misleading appearance of the data collection forms used by data brokers responsible for collecting the data did not allow valid consent to be obtained from the individuals concerned. The prominence given to the buttons requiring users to transmit their data for commercial prospecting purposes (by their size, colour, title and location), compared with the hypertext links enabling users to take part in the game without accepting this transmission (of a much smaller size and blending in with the body of the text), strongly encourages users to accept. See screenshots at https://www.cnil.fr/sites/cnil/files/2024-03/foriou_form_examples.pdf for more illustrations. The company was fined 1% of its turnover or EUR 310k.

- **EDPS says that the EC cannot use MS 365 without corrective measures** (https://www.edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2024/european-commissions-use-microsoft-365-infringes-data-protection-law-eu-institutions-and-bodies_en, https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2024-03/EDPS-2024-05-European-Commission_s-use-of-M365-infringes-data-protection-rules-for-EU-institutions-and-bodies_EN.pdf): In EDPS's opinion, the EC failed to comply with GDPR on the following matters: 
  - Purpose limitation:
    - failure to sufficiently determine the types of personal data collected;
    - failure to ensure that the purposes for which Microsoft is permitted to collect personal data are specified and explicit;
    - failure to ensure that Microsoft processes personal data to provide its services only on documented instructions from the Commission;
    - failure to assess whether the purposes for further processing are compatible with the purposes for which the personal data have initially been collected;
    - failure to assess whether it is necessary and proportionate to transmit the personal data to Microsoft Ireland and its sub-processors (including affiliates) located in the EEA for a specific purpose in the public interest;
  - Transfers outside of EU/EEA:
    - failure to clearly provide in the 2021 ILA what types of personal data can be transferred to which recipients in which third country and for which purposes, and to give Microsoft documented instructions in that regard;
    - has not appraised, either prior to the initiation of the transfers or subsequently, what personal data will be transferred to which recipients in which third countries and for which purposes, thereby not obtaining the minimum information necessary to determine whether any supplementary measures are required to ensure the essentially equivalent 5 level of protection and whether any effective supplementary measures exist and could be implemented;
    - had not implemented effective supplementary measures for transfers to the United States taking place prior to the entry into force of the US adequacy decision, in light of the Schrems II judgment, nor has it demonstrated that such measures existed;
    - concluding the Standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) for transfers from the Commission to Microsoft Corporation without having clearly mapped the proposed transfers, concluded a transfer impact assessment and included appropriate safeguards in those SCCs.

- **CJEU confirmed that a DPA can order data to be deleted** (https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-03/cp240048en.pdf): Member State may order of its own motion, namely even in the absence of a prior request made by the data subject to that effect, the erasure of unlawfully processed data if such a measure is necessary in order to fulfil its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced. If that authority finds that the treatment of data does not comply with the GDPR, it must remedy the infringement found, even without a prior request from the data subject.
