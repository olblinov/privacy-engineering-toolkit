- **Spanish DPA publishes risk management tool + risk factors** (https://gestiona2.aepd.es/): This tool enables the management of an entity's processing operations in the following aspects: management of the Records of Processing Activities, generation of the Inventory of Processing Operations and the minimum bases for initiating risk analysis and management activities within the scope of the GDPR, generation of reports and management and local storage of data. [List of risks identified by AEPD is available here](../../../pia/es_aepd_pia.md).

- **American Privacy Rights Act referred to Committee on Energy and Commerce** (https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/innovation-data-and-commerce-subcommittee-markup-recap-monumental-step-forward-for-data-privacy-and-kids-online-safety): The US is planning to adopt a federal privacy law (the “American Privacy Rights Act“) which will (1) replace state laws; and (2) bring the regulation much closer to EU’s GDPR level of protections. The law is far from adoption, but signifies a movement in the US to increase its standards up to GDPR’s level in terms of user rights, security, minimizing scope of data collected etc. 

- **CNIL provides detailed assessment of consent form in TAGADAMEDIA case** (https://www.cnil.fr/en/data-brokers-tagadamedia-fined-eu75000): TAGADAMEDIA collects data from prospects through forms it offers on its websites to participate in competitions or product testing. This data is then sent to the company's partners for commercial prospecting. During the investigations, the company provided the CNIL with two examples of forms for collecting data from prospective customers, such as those shown below. However, the presentation of these forms did not allow free, informed and unambiguous consent to be obtained. In fact, the highlighting of the button allowing users to give their consent in contrast to that of the button allowing users not to give their consent, or the incomplete text and reduced size, strongly encouraged users to agree to the transmission of their data to partners.

  - The company submitted the CNIL a new form during the sanction procedure, corresponding to the example below. The consent obtained via this new form still did not allow to obtain a valid consent, thereby depriving the processing operation of any legal basis. ![image2](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/cnil/files/2024-01/tagadamedia_form_example_procedure_2.png)
