The CNIL stated that accessing stored information without consent is a violation, even if the information is not subsequently used. In addition to the fine, the CNIL has ordered Orange to rectify its practices regarding cookie management and has imposed a daily penalty of 100,000 euros for non-compliance after a three-month period.

The companies allegedly collected and sold precise geolocation data from mobile devices without obtaining verifiable user consent.

Mobilewalla gathers vast amounts of personal information, including precise location data tied to individuals, from sources like real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges and data brokers. This information is then used to create audience segments based on sensitive characteristics, such as health conditions and religious beliefs, and sold to third parties for various purposes including advertising, political campaigns, and government use. The FTC alleges that these practices violate the FTC Act by causing substantial injury to consumers through loss of privacy and potential exposure to discrimination and other harms.

These patterns, designed to encourage users to accept cookies, often make it difficult to reject them. The CNIL's actions stem from numerous complaints and are based on the French Data Protection Act, its own guidelines, and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) recommendations. The core issue is that **rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them**, and any design that misleads users into consenting is considered a violation.

The Garante has issued a fine of €842,062.00 and has ordered Sky to cease its unlawful data processing activities.
- **Brazilian DPA investigates 20 companies for non-appointment of a DPO** (
https://www.gov.br/anpd/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/anpd-fiscaliza-20-empresas-por-falta-de-encarregado-e-canal-de-comunicacao): The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD) is **investigating 20 large companies** for failing to designate a Data Protection Officer (Encarregado) and provide adequate communication channels for data subjects, as required by the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD). This action is part of the Monitoring Cycle and aligns with the 2024-2025 Priority Themes Map, which emphasizes guaranteeing data subjects’ rights. The absence of an Encarregado or effective communication channel prevents data subjects from exercising their rights and undermines transparency in the processing of personal information, thus hindering the ANPD's ability to ensure compliance with the LGPD.

These guidelines provide practical recommendations for EU controllers and processors to navigate these requests, highlighting the need for a legal basis for processing under Article 6 and compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR for any data transfer.

The company also allegedly made unsubstantiated claims about its anti-spoofing technology. The FTC's proposed settlement includes prohibitions on further misrepresentations by IntelliVision regarding its facial recognition technology.
