- **Commission fines Meta €797.72 million over abusive practices benefitting Facebook Marketplace** (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5801): The European Commission has fined Meta €797.72 million for violating EU antitrust regulations. Meta was found to have abused its dominant positions in the markets for personal social network services and online display advertising. The company tied its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its social network, Facebook, and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers. This gave Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage that competitors could not match. The Commission has ordered Meta to cease these practices.
- **Meta's New Options for EU Users - Subscription, Personalized Ads, and Less Personalized Ads** (https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe/, https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2024/meta-med-nye-valgmuligheter/): Meta is introducing changes to its Facebook and Instagram platforms in the EU, offering users a choice between a paid subscription for an ad-free experience, continuing to use the services for free with personalized ads, or opting for a free service with less personalized ads. This change comes in response to demands from EU regulators regarding user data and advertising practices. The less personalized ads option uses significantly less user data, relying instead on context and basic information such as age, gender, and location. The aim is to provide users with greater control over their data and ad experience, though it may result in ads that are less relevant to their interests.
- **Meta's Violation of Korean Privacy Laws cost it $15M** (https://www.pipc.go.kr/np/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=BS074&mCode=C020010000&nttId=10726#LINK): The Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) of South Korea has imposed a fine of 21.6 billion won (approx USD 15M) on Meta for collecting and using sensitive personal information without proper consent.

The violations include inadequate data processing, lack of transparency, and insufficient protection of rider data, including the use of an algorithm without human oversight. The investigation was initiated following the death of a rider in 2022, and revealed that the company had failed to implement necessary data protection measures despite a prior warning.
- **FTC Order Against AI-Enabled Review Platform Sitejabber Will Ensure Consumers Get Truthful and Accurate Reviews** (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/11/ftc-order-against-ai-enabled-review-platform-sitejabber-will-ensure-consumers-get-truthful-accurate): The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against GGL Projects, Inc., also known as Sitejabber, for allegedly deceiving consumers by misrepresenting that the ratings and reviews on its platform came from customers who had actually experienced the reviewed products or services. Sitejabber collected feedback from customers at the point of purchase, before they had received their items, and then used this data to inflate the average ratings and review counts of its clients. The FTC alleges that this practice misled consumers into thinking that the high ratings reflected positive experiences with the products themselves, rather than just the shopping experience. Additionally, Sitejabber provided clients with tools to publish pre-fulfillment feedback on their own websites, further perpetuating the misrepresentation.
- **€5k Daily Fine Against Freedelity for Mutualization of Data** (https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/carte-d-identite-comme-carte-de-fidelite-l-apd-ordonne-a-freedelity-de-se-conformer-au-rgpd, https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-146-2024.pdf): The Autorité de protection des données (APD), the Belgian Data Protection Authority, has issued a decision against Freedelity, a company specializing in collecting and mutualizing customer data, for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This case underscores the importance of adhering to deletion obligations under the GDPR.
- **ANPD Orders TikTok to Address Children's Data Privacy Violations in Brazil** (https://www.gov.br/anpd/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/anpd-abre-processo-sancionador-e-emite-determinacoes-ao-tiktok, https://www.gov.br/anpd/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/nota-tecnica-50_pub_0153891.pdf): The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD) in Brazil investigated TikTok’s data processing practices following a 2021 complaint, uncovering significant privacy violations regarding children and adolescents. TikTok collects personal data, including from children, via a "feed sem cadastro" feature that bypasses account creation and ineffective age verification measures, using this data for content personalization and targeted advertising without a valid legal basis. These practices breach several provisions of the LGPD, including the requirement to prioritize children's best interests, process data with a valid legal basis, and ensure accountability. Consequently, the ANPD mandated the immediate suspension of the "feed sem cadastro" in Brazil, required TikTok to implement a compliance plan with effective safeguards for children’s data, and initiated administrative sanctions, demanding proof of compliance within ten business days.
- **Court of Justice Ruling on GDPR Article 14(5)(c) Exception Applying to Generated Data** (https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=292739&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=10702385): The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has issued a ruling clarifying the scope of the exception in Article 14(5)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning the obligation to provide information to data subjects when their personal data is not collected directly from them. The CJEU determined that the exception applies not only to data obtained from third parties but also to data generated by the data controller itself, provided that the data processing is expressly laid down by law and that the law includes appropriate safeguards for the data subject's interests. Additionally, the CJEU ruled that **a supervisory authority is competent to verify whether national law provides adequate protection for data subjects’ rights** in the context of this exception, but **this does not extend to the appropriateness of security measures under Article 32 of the GDPR**.
- **EUR 200k fine for deleting information from employee's device** (https://www.aepd.es/documento/ps-00277-2024.pdf): The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) initiated a sanction procedure against Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA) after a former employee reported that the bank remotely wiped the data on a personal cell phone that the employee had purchased from the bank after terminating employment. The AEPD determined that the bank violated Article 6.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by deleting personal data from the device without a legal basis. BBVA acknowledged responsibility by paying a reduced fine of 120,000 euros, which terminated the sanction procedure.
- **Belgian Court dismisses case on right to be forgotten against Google** (https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/decision-quant-au-fond-n0-134-2024.pdf): This case involves a complaint against Google LLC and Google Belgium for refusing to dereference URLs containing personal data about the plaintiff. The plaintiff was convicted of serious offenses in 2008, and articles about these convictions were indexed by Google. The plaintiff requested the removal of these links, but Google refused, citing public interest. The plaintiff then filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (APD) after a failed mediation attempt, which was ultimately dismissed. The Chamber Contentieuse decided to close the case because the plaintiff initially targeted the newspaper responsible for publishing the article and because a request for URL 2 was not made to Google beforehand. The Chamber Contentieuse further found that the balance between the public's right to information and the plaintiff's right to privacy favored the freedom of expression in this case.
