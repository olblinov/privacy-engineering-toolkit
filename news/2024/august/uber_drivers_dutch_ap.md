Decision to impose administrative fine

Dear [confidential],

The Authority Personal Data (AP) has decided to impose an administrative fine of €290,000,000 on Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV (hereinafter collectively: Uber). The AP is of the opinion that Uber has violated Article 44 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by transferring personal data to the United States without providing appropriate safeguards as required under Chapter V of the GDPR.

The AP believes that the imposition of an administrative fine on Uber is not only appropriate but also necessary. The AP has noted that the intended protection under Article 44 GDPR, namely ensuring the high level of data protection guaranteed by the GDPR during the transfer of personal data to third countries, is not ensured by Uber. The AP considers this a serious violation, which is why enforcement against Uber has been initiated.

This decision will explain the administrative fine. It will successively cover the reasons for the investigation, the facts, the identified violation, and the amount of the fine. The conclusion will provide the ruling.

# 1. Cause research

1. Uber is an international company that acts as an intermediary between taxi drivers and passengers. Passengers use the Uber App (for mobile phones) or possibly a browser to book a ride. Drivers use the Uber Driver App (hereinafter: driver app) to offer rides.

2. To use the driver app, it is mandatory for drivers to create an account. Drivers are rated by their customers after a ride and are paid by Uber for the services provided.

3. On 12 June 2020, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) received a complaint from the French non-governmental organization Ligue des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen (LDH) on behalf of 21 Uber drivers. Gradually, 151 additional Uber drivers joined the complaint, so that the complaint was submitted on behalf of 172 complainants. LDH subsequently submitted an additional complaint to CNIL on 29 September 2020, which was transferred to the AP on 11 January 2021.

4. In the additional complaint, the complainants claimed that Uber's legal position was unclear regarding the so-called Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). The Schrems II ruling stated that there is no equivalent level of protection in the United States for the transfer of personal data from the European Union (EU) to the United States. As a result, the U.S. Privacy Shield was no longer valid as a data transfer mechanism. However, the ECJ noted that the use of "Standard Contractual Clauses" (SCC) could continue as long as adequate additional measures are taken to ensure an equivalent level of protection.

5. On 16 April 2021, the AP notified Uber in writing that it had initiated an investigation into the complaints submitted by French Uber drivers. The investigation focused on whether Uber complied with the requirements of Chapter V GDPR regarding the transfer of personal data of drivers from the EU to the United States.

6. The AP found that Uber had violated Article 44 of the GDPR by transferring personal data without providing appropriate safeguards, as required under Chapter V of the GDPR. The investigation report was sent to Uber on 13 April 2023. Uber submitted its view on the investigation report by letter dated 9 June 2023. Uber further explained its point of view during an oral hearing at the AP's office on 5 July 2023.

# 2. Facts and circumstances

## 2.1 Introduction

7. Uber is the name of an electronic platform developed by Uber Technologies Incorporated (UTI), headquartered in San Francisco, United States. In the European Economic Area (EEA), Uber is represented by Uber BV (UBV), headquartered in the Netherlands. In the cities where Uber operates, the platform enables passengers to book transportation services provided by Uber drivers operating in those territories.

8. According to Uber's privacy statement, UBV and UTI are joint data controllers for the processing of personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA. Their responsibilities concerning compliance with the GDPR are described in an agreement.

9. UBV has various data processing agreements with other Uber subsidiaries within EEA countries. For example, Uber France SAS, a subsidiary in France, designates UBV as the data controller and Uber France SAS as the processor. UBV is responsible for making personal data of Uber drivers available to other subsidiaries in the EEA. However, Uber has clarified that while UBV is responsible for the personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA, it is technically accessible through UTI.

10. Uber drivers in the EEA must sign a contract with UBV to operate as drivers for Uber.

---

## 2.2 Uber drivers and the driver app

11. Uber describes drivers as "users of the platform who provide transportation services individually or through partner transportation companies using the Uber Driver application." To become an Uber driver, one must create an account on the driver app. Drivers must also accept the 'Conditions for Independent Uber Partners,' which can be unilaterally amended by Uber.

12. Once the driver meets the conditions and logs into the app, they can go 'online.' The driver can then accept, decline, or ignore ride requests from nearby passengers. A driver who ignores three consecutive ride requests is automatically logged out of the platform. However, the driver still retains access to other platform features. Drivers can also cancel rides they have already accepted. Uber monitors the percentage of rides canceled by each driver.

13. After completing a ride, the passenger is asked to rate the driver on a scale of 1 to 5. A driver with an average score below a certain threshold (previously 4.5 out of 5) could be excluded from the platform.

14. During a ride request, the driver receives information about the type of ride requested (UberX, Uber Green, etc.), the passenger's name, user rating, pick-up location (including distance to the driver), destination location, and estimated ride duration. The driver can contact the passenger via text message or phone call. The passenger receives information about the driver, including the driver's name, photo, rating, vehicle type, license plate number, and the driver's live location.

15. Uber offers drivers various classifications such as Gold, Platinum, or Diamond, which provide certain privileges. A driver must meet criteria, including maintaining a rating of 4.85 or higher, an acceptance rate of 85% or higher, and a cancellation rate of 4% or lower, to achieve higher classifications.

16. Disputes between passengers and drivers, such as fare disputes, are handled by Uber. In such cases, Uber may decide to refund the passenger partially or fully, resulting in the driver receiving a lower payout.

17. Uber reserves the right to unilaterally deny a driver access to the platform for reasons such as non-compliance with guidelines, fraud, unacceptable behavior, or dangerous driving. A driver with an average rating below 4.5 out of 5 could also be excluded from the platform in the past.

## 2.3 The processing activities

18. Uber operates a centralized IT infrastructure, with UTI's servers located in the United States. Personal data of Uber drivers located in the EEA is stored on these servers in the United States. The AP identified two relevant situations where data transfers qualify as international transfers under the GDPR.

19. In the first situation, personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA is collected via the driver app and stored on a platform physically located in the United States. This data includes account information, location data, identity documents, criminal and health records, and taxi licenses, depending on the legal requirements in each country.

20. In the second situation, Uber drivers can exercise their GDPR rights. UBV is responsible for evaluating requests related to data subject rights and communicating with data subjects, while UTI is responsible for making personal data available to UBV to respond to requests. This process involves the structural exchange of personal data between UBV in the Netherlands and UTI in the United States.

21. In the first scenario, the personal data of Uber drivers located within the EEA is collected and stored on a platform physically located in the United States. According to Uber, when a driver uses the app for the first time, they are asked to provide personal data such as their name, email address, and phone number. This data is then stored on UTI’s servers in the United States without any technical intervention from UBV or other European subsidiaries.

---

## Situation 2

22. The second scenario involves the rights of individuals under the GDPR, particularly the assessment of the scope of requests by individuals regarding their rights and the communication about exercising these rights.

23. Uber explains that the data traffic begins when an Uber driver submits a request related to their rights under the GDPR and ends when Uber responds to the request. The data traffic between the individual, UBV, and UTI depends on the specific request submitted by the driver. Uber describes the standard procedure used to handle such requests.

24. According to Uber, the first step in this procedure involves the way the individual submits the request. Uber provides drivers with several ways to exercise their GDPR rights, including:

- (a) Filling out a form in the driver app or on Uber's website.
- (b) Sending an email to Uber.
- (c) Using other forms of communication, such as sending a letter or calling an Uber employee.

---

### Ad (a)

25. The driver app and Uber’s website use UTI’s servers, located in the United States. When an Uber driver exercises their rights under the GDPR directly through the driver app or the website, the handling of such requests and the associated data stream occurs directly via the driver's smartphone or other device in the EEA to UTI’s servers in the United States. Uber clarifies that UTI is the entity receiving the request since the request is made via Uber’s platform, which is operated and managed by UTI.

---

### Ad (b)

26. An Uber driver may choose to exercise their rights by sending an email to an address within the uber.com domain. In this case, Uber's email traffic uses the IT systems located on UTI’s servers in the United States. Therefore, the data traffic occurs directly between the individual’s personal device in the EEA and UTI’s systems in the United States.

---

### Ad (c)

27. Uber drivers may also choose to exercise their rights by sending a letter or making a phone call. However, Uber mentions that these methods account for fewer than 10 requests per year in the European Union. When the Uber driver chooses to send a letter to UTI’s address in the United States or calls a colleague in the U.S. to make their request known, there is still data traffic from the EEA to the U.S.

28. If the driver chooses to send their request to UBV or another subsidiary within the EEA, data traffic is then handled directly between the driver and the EEA entity. Uber also highlights that if the driver calls an Uber employee located in the EEA, the employee will advise the driver to submit the request through the driver app, as this is the fastest route for handling the request. If the driver chooses not to follow this advice, the employee enters the request into UTI’s IT systems, which are located in the United States. This access is granted remotely from the EEA.

---

29. When a driver sends a letter, UBV forwards it to UTI. The forwarding process and the note made during the phone call are processed digitally by UBV employees, who use their computer browsers to access UTI’s systems in the United States. Uber emphasizes that, in this situation, there is data traffic from a computer in the EEA to systems in the U.S.

---

30. Uber further explains that an Uber driver submitting a request through the app or the website does not need to enter personal data into the platform. Most Uber drivers are logged in via their personal accounts, and the data traffic consists of the request and the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) linked to the driver's account. Each account on Uber's platform is associated with a UUID, allowing the driver to be identified within Uber’s systems.

31. If the Uber driver is not logged into the platform, they may submit a request by providing details such as their name, email address, and phone number linked to their Uber account. This information is necessary to link the request to the driver's UUID and process the request. Similarly, if the driver makes the request via email, post, or phone, they are asked for the same type of information.

---

32. The second step in the process involves preparing a response to the request. Most requests are handled automatically through the self-service portal that drivers have access to. The self-service portal, located on UTI's servers in the U.S., offers two functions: "Explore Your Data," which allows the driver to view their personal data, and "Download Your Data," which allows the driver to download a copy of their personal data.

33. If the request can be fully handled by the self-service portal, all necessary personal data is automatically collected from UTI’s systems. The data is shared directly with the individual without any intervention from an Uber employee. Uber asserts that there is no data traffic from the EEA to the U.S. in this fully automated process.

---

34. When the self-service portal cannot handle the request due to complexity, an Uber employee must manually prepare the response. Uber notes that approximately 25 such requests are manually handled per month during the first four months of 2023.

35. In the manual process, a UBV colleague must review the request. The colleague does this by accessing UTI's systems in the U.S. from a browser on their computer located in the EEA. Uber states that in this situation, there is data traffic from the U.S. to the EEA, including the UUID and the request contents.

36. Uber notes that the nature of the request determines which type of personal data needs to be collected. Since Uber operates a centralized IT infrastructure with servers in the U.S., personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA is stored in the U.S. To respond to a request, the colleague must collect the relevant data from UTI's servers.

37. Once the relevant personal data is collected on UTI’s servers, the UBV employee verifies that the data meets the scope of the request. If the data is insufficient, the employee performs a new search until the necessary data is gathered. Uber states that the colleague does not add any personal data to the spreadsheet containing the results.

38. Uber explains that during the collection of data, there is almost exclusively data traffic within the United States. Furthermore, Uber emphasizes that the UBV employee only has access to personal data stored on UTI’s servers in the U.S., and this data does not come to the server or computer located in the EEA. The only data traffic from the EEA to the U.S. involves entering the parameters for the selection of data, which is then processed on UTI’s systems.

39. The final step in the (partially manual) handling procedure for the rights of individuals involves providing the response to the request. Once the spreadsheet with the personal data is ready, it is made available to the Uber driver. The UBV employee, through their browser, accesses UTI’s systems and the spreadsheet stored on UTI’s servers in the U.S. The employee then exports the spreadsheet to a "file mailbox" within UTI’s systems, which remains within the U.S. infrastructure.

40. Uber explains that the 'file mailbox' is located on UTI’s servers and that the spreadsheet containing the personal data remains on UTI’s server. After the data is transferred to the file mailbox, the UBV employee opens the file and makes it available to the Uber driver. More specifically, a link to the data is sent to the Uber driver in the EEA, who can download the personal data through this link. According to Uber, this is the only point at which data traffic moves from the U.S. to the EEA.

41. Uber notes that there is a temporary exception to this process when it involves proof of payment. If a request for inspection by a driver includes a proof of payment element, the UBV employee downloads the proof of payment from UTI’s servers to their computer in the EEA. The document is then manually uploaded by the UBV employee to the 'file mailbox' on UTI’s servers in the U.S. After the document is uploaded, the UBV employee deletes the file from their computer. This process temporarily involves the transfer of personal data from the U.S. to the EEA and then back to the U.S. Uber notes that this handling of payment receipts is temporary and will be aligned with the above-mentioned procedure for handling requests in the near future.

## 2.4 Number of Uber drivers and GDPR requests by those involved

42. The AP asked Uber for the number of registered Uber drivers in the EU and how often individuals have exercised their GDPR rights.

43. From 6 August 2021 to mid-February 2023, there were an average of [confidential] drivers active in France and [confidential] drivers in the entire EU. As of 17 February 2023, there were a total of [confidential] active drivers in the EU.

44. Between August 2021 and February 2023, Uber processed [confidential] access requests from drivers in the EU using the automatic 'Download Your Data' tool, which allows drivers to download their personal data based on generic categories provided by Uber. Additionally, Uber processed [confidential] deletion requests for (former) drivers in the EU. Uber also mentions that between 6 August 2021 and 1 February 2023, [confidential] requests from French (former) drivers involved more extensive access requests.

---

## 2.5 The application of a transfer mechanism by Uber

45. Uber declared the following regarding the transfer of personal data to third countries:  
“For transfers of data subjects' data to third countries, Uber's standard practice has been to have standard contractual clauses (SCCs) in place when a third country has not been afforded an adequacy decision to ensure a high level of protection, and to conduct a ‘third-party risk management’ assessment to identify potential risks and ensure data protection for its users’ data.”

46. However, in 2021, Uber decided that no standard contractual clauses were necessary for the processing of personal data of EU drivers in the United States. Uber argued that there was no transfer in the first place and that due to the joint responsibility between UBV and UTI, Article 3 GDPR fully applied to the personal data processed in the United States.

47. Referring to the updated SCCs issued by the European Commission, Uber stated:  
“In light of this, Uber revisited its joint controller agreement to delete the SCCs and clarify joint controller responsibilities. Therefore, Uber has adopted a new version of its joint controller agreement, in which the new regulatory requirements and the relationship between UTI and UBV are reflected.”

48. The Data Sharing Agreement Uber refers to is dated 6 August 2021. Based on Uber’s declaration, the AP concluded that Uber had removed the standard contractual clauses from the Data Sharing Agreement for the transfer of personal data to third countries as of 6 August 2021. Uber had not implemented any alternative transfer mechanisms, such as binding corporate rules or a certification mechanism.

49. On 10 July 2023, the European Commission adopted the adequacy decision 'EU-US Data Privacy Framework.' Uber certified itself under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework on 27 November 2023.

50. In Uber’s privacy statement, it stated:  
“When we transfer user data from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, we do so on the basis of the necessity to fulfill our agreements with users, consent, adequacy decisions regarding the country of transfer... and transfer mechanisms such as the Standard Contractual Clauses... and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.”

# 3. Point of view Uber

51. The AP has determined that Uber violated Article 44 GDPR 
> by transferring personal data to the United States from 6 August 2021 to 27 November 2023 without a valid adequacy decision and without providing appropriate safeguards. The AP summarizes Uber’s point of view in this section, and a legal substantiation follows in Chapter 4.

---

## Application of Chapter V GDPR

47. Uber considers that Article 44 GDPR has not been violated, because Chapter V of the GDPR does not apply to the processing operations under investigation. Firstly, according to Uber, Chapter V is not applicable, because Article 3 GDPR already applies. According to Uber, Chapter V is intended to catch cases that fall outside the scope of Article 3 GDPR, so that the protection provided by the GDPR is not undermined. Because the data is already protected by the application of Article 3 GDPR, simultaneous application of Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR is redundant and therefore pointless.

48. Second, Uber argues that Chapter V is subordinate to Article 3 and cannot therefore be applied simultaneously. According to Uber, another interpretation is contrary to the EU's international obligations, in particular the WTO Agreement and the associated GATS agreement. It follows from these international obligations that Member States may not treat non-European entities less favourably than European entities under the agreement. Case law has established that secondary Community law, including the GDPR, must be interpreted as much as possible in line with international law. A simultaneous application of Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V is contrary to the EU's obligations under international law and the obligation to interpret secondary Community law in line with international law. Therefore, the relationship between Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR must be interpreted in such a way that they cannot apply simultaneously.

---

**The concept of 'transfer'**

49. Uber argues that the concept of 'transfer' is not defined by the GDPR. This was a deliberate choice of the European legislator who did so despite the objections and advice of various institutions such as the EDPS, the EECC and the EDPB. In addition, European data protection authorities, including the AP, have never given substance to the concept until 14 February 2023, despite the fact that this was requested by various stakeholders. It was not until 14 February 2023 that the EDPB provided a substance to the concept of 'transfer', but in addition to the fact that it itself admits that it is a legally uncertain concept because the GDPR does not provide a definition of it, the EDPB's own interpretation is only one possible interpretation and moreover non-binding. In addition, the EDPB has requested the EC to further clarify the concept. The AP cannot rely on this single interpretation for the above without further substantiation.

---

**There is no transfer in the present case**

50. Uber further argues that there is no transfer because, according to the EDPB guidelines, there must be a processor or controller acting as an exporter of the personal data, while in this case it concerns data subjects who themselves make the personal data directly available to UTI. To the extent that it is argued that Uber exports the data because the drivers do so under the responsibility of UBV, this argument fails, because the AP is thereby introducing a new standard that does not follow from the guidelines or from the GDPR. In addition, the argument fails because 1) the actual data transfer must be assessed, 2) it does not follow from the qualification as joint controller that UBV itself makes the personal data available and 3) it does not follow from the actual and legal division of responsibilities between UBV and UTI that UBV is responsible for sharing personal data with UTI when a driver does so.

**Transfer instruments and grounds for exemption**

51. Uber argues that even if there were a transfer, such a transfer would be in line with Chapter V of the GDPR. First, until 6 August 2021, Uber implemented standard contractual clauses in the Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) between joint controllers UBV and UTI as a non-mandatory safeguard for the data traffic under investigation. Uber removed the standard contractual clauses from this in good faith, because on 4 June 2021, with the introduction of new standard contractual clauses, the EC stated in the recitals that the new standard contractual clauses may not be used to the extent that the processing by the importer falls within the scope of Article 3(2) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the lack of any progress by the EC in developing standard contractual clauses specifically for importers who already fall within the scope of the GDPR shows that the EC has so far taken the position that the application of Article 3 GDPR precludes the application of Chapter V of the GDPR. According to Uber, it is at least certain that no standard contractual provisions were available to Uber in the meantime. In addition to the

According to Uber, standard contractual clauses are not realistic alternatives at this time.

52. Secondly, any transfer of personal data by Uber is lawful, because Uber considers that it can rely on the exception in Article 49 paragraph 1 sub b and c GDPR. Uber states that a transfer based on Article 49 GDPR does not require that the level of protection in the third country is broadly equivalent to the level of protection guaranteed within the EU by the GDPR. According to Uber, merely meeting the conditions as mentioned in Article 49 GDPR is sufficient. This follows, among other things, from the wording of the GDPR and from recital 202 of Schrems II.

53. In any case, according to Uber, it is not required for either ground for exception, as the AP states, that the transfer is "incidental". Although this does follow from recital 111 of the GDPR, this is at odds with the text of the GDPR itself, the case law of the CJEU and the manual of the central government. Firstly, 'incidental' is not in the text of the GDPR. In fact, it states that art. 49 can also be used for a series of transfers. Secondly, recitals in the GDPR do not create a new standard and do not have independent legal force, as is also confirmed by, among other things, standard case law of the CJEU. Thirdly, judges do not use 'incidental' as a condition, and art. 49 must be interpreted broadly in the case of data transfers within companies or a group of companies. Fourthly, the manual of the Ministry of Justice and Security does not mention 'incidental' as a condition. In addition, grounds b and c require that the transfer is necessary, but, as follows from Dutch case law, this connection of necessity does not have to be close and substantial.

54. Uber argues that if it is assumed that there is an international transfer, it can invoke Article 49 paragraph 1 sub c for the situation in which drivers make GDPR requests and Article 49 paragraph 1 sub b for cases in which drivers use the driver app.

55. As regards the situation where GDPR requests are made by drivers, this transfer meets all the conditions of Art. 49 paragraph 1 sub c GDPR. In particular, because the transfer necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person. The contract is concluded in the interest of the data subject, because the DSA regulates and facilitates the GDPR rights that constitute and support the data protection of the drivers, this also follows from Art. 26 GDPR and the associated recital 79. The transfer is furthermore necessary for the performance of the contract. The transfer takes place within the framework of the DSA and is directly related to the completion of access requests. In addition, the data transfer is unavoidable due to Uber's centralized IT infrastructure, which in turn is crucial for Uber's specific service provision as well as for the global application of Uber's technical and organizational GDPR measures. Finally, according to Uber, there are very few data transfers in the context of access requests (only 25 per month).

56. As regards the situation in which drivers use the driver app, the transfer meets all the conditions of Article 49 paragraph 1 sub b, and in particular the condition that the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller (UBV and UTI via the DSA). According to Uber, the necessity follows from being able to fulfill the contract between UBV and the driver. Uber must fulfill its contractual obligation to offer rides, and can only do so on the basis of the transfer of data from the driver (e.g. his location). The transfer of data is therefore necessary to fulfill the contract between the driver and Uber.

---

# 4. Assessment

## 4.1 Processing of personal data

57. The AP arrives at the following assessment. The use of the driver app requires the creation of a account for drivers required. The documents and personal information collected during this registration enable Uber to start its processing activities of personal data of Uber drivers.

58. The AP determined in paragraph 2.3 that Uber processes various data from Uber in this context drivers. In addition to account information, location data, photos, receipts and ratings, Uber also processes (depending on the legal rules in a country) other data, such as identity documents, criminal records and health data.

59. The AP is of the opinion that Uber processes personal data as referred to in Article 4, sections 1 and 2, of the GDPR.

## 4.2 Controller and authority of the AP

60. Uber BV is a company established in the Netherlands and is part of the Uber group. Uber Technologies Inc. is based in the United States and is the parent company of, among others, Uber BV. The (French) drivers have entered into an agreement with Uber BV.

61. The terms “controller” and “processor” are functional terms: they are intended to allocate responsibilities according to the actual role of the parties, meaning that the legal status of a party as a “controller” or a “processor” should in principle be determined by its actual activities in a specific situation, and not by the formal designation of a party as a “controller” or a “processor” (e.g. in a contract).

62. Uber BV and Uber Technologies Inc. jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing fixed for the personal data of Uber drivers in the European Economic Area (EEA). The AP is therefore of the opinion that UBV and UTI should be regarded as joint controllers for the international transfer that is part of two larger series of processing activities as described in situations 1 and 2. The joint controllership has not been contested by Uber. For requests relating to the rights of data subjects (situation 2), the division is that UBV is responsible for assessing such requests and that UTI makes the technical means and the personal data available. UTI is also the publisher of the driver app.

63. The AP further notes that when processing personal data of Uber drivers, data are processed in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or processor in the Union, as provided for in Article 3(1) of the GDPR.

64. Finally, Uber offers its services in several EU Member States and for these services Uber processes personal data. This means that data subjects in more than one Member State are substantially affected by the processing of personal data by Uber. This constitutes cross-border processing (Article 4, opening words and under 23, sub a and b, GDPR). The AP notes that Uber's central administration in the EEA is located at Uber BV. Uber BV is therefore regarded as the main establishment within the meaning of Article 4, section 16, GDPR. In view thereof, the AP is competent to act as lead supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 56, first paragraph, GDPR.

---

## 4.3 Territorial scope and Chapter V GDPR

65. Uber considers that Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR cannot apply simultaneously.

66. The AP notes that the rationale for data transfers under Chapter V GDPR is complementary to the rationale for the territorial scope of the GDPR as set out in Article 3, namely to prevent the protection afforded to data by EU law from being withheld, undermined or circumvented. By declaring EU law applicable to processing operations that take place outside the borders of the EEA, Article 3 GDPR aims to safeguard the high level of data protection guaranteed by the GDPR. The provisions in Chapter V GDPR on transfers achieve this by making the application of protection based on EU standards mandatory for such processing operations. It should be noted that while the GDPR applies to all processing operations under Article 3 GDPR, the application of the GDPR outside the EEA territory does not offer the same protection. The application of the GDPR in the Union is based on the legal framework of EU legislation in areas such as the recognition and enforcement of judgments/decisions, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the Data Protection Authorities and other basic areas which, by their nature, do not apply to third countries. In several judgments relating to international data transfers, the CJEU has expressed this concern by assessing whether personal data have been processed in a manner that complies with EU standards. The AP therefore notes that the provisions in Chapter V contain mechanisms that counterbalance the effort required to enforce obligations under EU law against parties in third countries. The AP considers that any other interpretation of these mechanisms would lead to a weakening of the protection offered within the Union, which is not in line with the standard required by the CJEU.

> 67. In further explanation of the foregoing, the AP notes that it is difficult to enforce compliance with the GDPR against foreign companies including Uber within the jurisdiction of the United States. To counterbalance this, the provisions on data transfers in Chapter V of the GDPR do not impose a direct obligation on parties processing data in third countries, by requiring them to comply with the standards of the GDPR.

68. With regard to Uber's argument that Article 3 GDPR prevails over Chapter V, or the argument not to apply provisions of Chapter V when Article 3 GDPR applies, the AP notes that any variation to the interpretation described would be contrary to the status of Chapter V within the structure of the GDPR. Article 44 GDPR establishes the link between Chapter V and the other provisions by providing that transfers of personal data may only take place if all other relevant provisions of the GDPR are complied with. The CJEU has confirmed this view by stating that the transfer of personal data to a third country constitutes processing falling within the scope of the GDPR and that where the GDPR applies, the provisions relating to data transfers must also apply. 
> Furthermore, the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter: EDPB) states that the application of the GDPR entails that all provisions of the GDPR apply to processing operations falling within the territorial scope of the GDPR, including the obligations set out in Chapter V of the GDPR.

69. The AP notes that there are important differences between Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR and explicitly states that Article 3 GDPR does not prevail over Chapter V. Furthermore, there are consequences to not applying Chapter V GDPR. The territorial scope as laid down in Article 3(1) GDPR means that the regulation applies to processing of personal data in the context of activities of an establishment of a controller or processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union. The GDPR therefore also applies if the processing does not technically take place in the Union, but is bound by the GDPR through a stable relationship with a stable establishment in the Union (such as a branch or subsidiary). Such a relationship is assumed quite quickly, for example if the establishment in the Union generates income for the parent entity in the third country. This is certainly the case between Uber BV and UTI in the present case. In contrast, the provisions on data transfers set out in Chapter V address the specific context of transfers of personal data to an entity in a third country by a processor or controller, where the exporter of the personal data must provide appropriate safeguards to ensure that the personal data enjoy an equivalent level of protection as that provided by the GDPR within the Union. 
> This protection is therefore complementary to Article 3 GDPR. This additional set of provisions of the GDPR sets a high standard of protection, both in practice and in law, to prevent the protections provided by EU law from being circumvented.

70. Finally, with regard to the relationship between Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR, Uber argues that the GDPR (being secondary EU law) must be interpreted in accordance with international agreements, in the present case the WTO agreements.

71. First, Uber notes that the European Union, and each of its Member States, is a party to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) and the Annexes to the WTO Agreement (including the GATS Agreement). It follows from these international agreements that non-European entities, such as UTI, may not be treated less favourably than European entities by the participating states. Since, according to Uber, simultaneous application of both the obligations of the GDPR based on Article 3 GDPR and Chapter V GDPR would be less favourable to UTI as a non-European entity, Uber considers that both systems cannot be applied simultaneously. In conclusion, the AP’s explanation, namely that Chapter V and Article 3 GDPR can be applied simultaneously, is, according to Uber, in conflict with the EU's international obligations.

72. Although the AP will not dispute that the GDPR should in principle be interpreted as much as possible in accordance with international agreements, it must conclude that Uber's argument fails to recognise that case law has already established that two cumulative conditions must be met for the interpretation proposed by Uber, namely:

73. The nature and scheme of that agreement (the WTO Agreement in this case) do not preclude an action for annulment or for a plea of illegality against (secondary) Union law (the GDPR);
74. The provision (the WTO Agreement) is sufficiently unconditional and sufficient in content precisely in order to be able to bring an action for annulment or for a plea of illegality against secondary Union law (the GDPR).

75. It follows from settled case law that the WTO Agreement does not meet at least the first requirement. Its nature and structure preclude the WTO Agreement from taking precedence over the GDPR. It also precludes the proposition that the WTO Agreement is leading for the interpretation of secondary EU law (such as the GDPR). The AP therefore also maintains its position in this context that Article 3 GDPR (and all obligations arising therefrom) and Chapter V GDPR apply simultaneously in this case.

76. In addition, paragraph 3 of the introduction to the annexed schedule, to which Uber refers in its written submissions, states in so many words that the rights and obligations arising from the GATS, including the schedule of commitments, do not have direct effect, “and therefore do not directly confer rights on individual natural or legal persons.” Uber cannot therefore rely on the WTO Agreement and the associated GATS commitments in the present case.

## 4.4 Is there a transfer of personal data?

### 4.4.1 Legal framework

75. Article 44 GDPR provides that “personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation may be transferred only if, without prejudice to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and the processor; this also applies to onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. All provisions of this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.”

76. Furthermore, Recital 101 of the GDPR notes that “[...] However, where personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or international organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. [...] In any event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only take place in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer may take place only if the controller or processor, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, complies with the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations.”

77. The GDPR does not provide a definition of 'transfer'. However, in its Guidelines, the EDPB has established three cumulative criteria that a transfer should meet:

1. A controller or a processor (“exporter”) is subject to the GDPR for the given processing activity.

2. Personal data which are the subject of such processing shall be transmitted by the exporter by means of forwarded or otherwise made available to another controller, joint controller or processor (“importer”).

3. The importer is located in a third country (regardless of whether or not the importer is authorised to do so for the particular processing activity pursuant to Article 3 of the GDPR) or is an international organisation.

78. If the above criteria are met, there is a transfer and Chapter V of the GDPR applies. This means that the transfer may only take place under the conditions set out in an adequacy decision of the European Commission or by providing appropriate safeguards. If this is not met, the GDPR provides for derogations (exceptions) for specific situations.

79. In the present case, the AP assesses whether processing operations described in situations 1 and 2 can be regarded as transfers of personal data for which the provisions set out in Chapter V of the GDPR must be complied with.

### 4.4.2 Assessment

80. With regard to the first criterion, the AP finds that the processing meets the requirements of Article 3(1) GDPR, namely that a controller or processor is subject to the GDPR with regard to the processing in question. This conclusion is acknowledged by Uber. More specifically, Uber has stated that UBV, with regard to the processing of the personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA, is subject to the GDPR. And Uber further expressly states that both UBV and UTI are bound by the GDPR under Article 3(1) GDPR.

81. As regards the second criterion, Uber argues that there is no transfer. Uber explains this by stating that “Chapter V of the GDPR does not apply to certain aspects of Uber’s business and the related international data flows do not qualify as international data transfers” because UBV and UTI are joint controllers to whom the GDPR applies directly by virtue of Article 3(1) GDPR. Despite this reasoning, Uber nevertheless acknowledges that data transfers take place between UBV and UTI. However, according to their written statements, they consider that these do not qualify as transfers because both UBV and UTI are subject to the GDPR.

82. The AP is of a different opinion. As noted earlier, the failure to apply Chapter V of the GDPR because UBV and UTI fall directly under the GDPR would undermine the high level of protection of the GDPR. Transfers can take place in different types of circumstances where entities fall under the GDPR under Article 3 GDPR. Transfers between joint controllers falling under Article 3 can also take place and are not excluded from the provisions of the GDPR on transfers. This understanding is in line with the position of the EDPB as reflected in the second transfer criterion: “Personal data which are the subject of such processing are transmitted or otherwise made available by the exporter to another controller, joint controller or processor (“importer”) by means of transmission.”

83. The CJEU requires that data protection be effective in law and in practice. This means that there must be effective redress mechanisms and remedies against violations of the GDPR. If the processing in question falls under the GDPR and the personal data are processed by an entity outside the Union, the processing is subject to legal frameworks that may conflict with or undermine the GDPR. Regulations on international transfers therefore provide a counterbalance to the difficulty of enforcing obligations under EU law against parties outside the Union.

84. According to the CJEU, the concept of controller as laid down in Article 4, introductory phrase and under point 7, of the GDPR must be interpreted broadly in order to ensure effective and complete protection of the data subjects. In the opinion of the AP, this concept must be applied analogously to the concept of 'exporter'. A restrictive interpretation of the criterion of 'exporter' would mean that Uber drivers would not be effectively and completely protected, because there would then be no question of an accountable exporter who is responsible for fulfilling obligations regarding the transfer of personal data outside the EEA. The exporter is the entity that must comply with the Chapter V transfer rules and must assess which appropriate safeguards are necessary to ensure an equivalent level of protection of personal data (as guaranteed under the GDPR). In addition, the data subject must be able to hold the controller accountable for his or her accountability within the meaning of Article 5, paragraph 2 in conjunction with Article 44 GDPR.

85. Furthermore, the CJEU requires that personal data originating from the Union must be subject to a high level of protection, even if they are processed in or transferred to third countries. Any interpretation or implementation of the provisions of Article 3 and Chapter V must meet that standard. For this reason too, the AP considers that the concept of 'exporter' in the second criterion as elaborated in the EDPB Guidelines should not be interpreted restrictively.

86. Developments in law and case law also mean that a restrictive interpretation is not consistent with the aim of providing a high level of protection for personal data. From the moment the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (hereinafter: the Charter) became primary law, the CJEU has relied on the Charter to emphasise the high level of protection for international transfers in the context of international agreements concluded by the Union, decisions of the Commission and the Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

In its judgments, the AP views international transfers from the perspective that providing a high level of protection is the starting point and the AP interprets the term 'exporter' broadly.

87. In the present case, and taking into account the technical developments, the 'exporter' criterion (a controller or processor in the EEA who transfers personal data to a third country) deviates from the so-called classic model. To illustrate this, the AP notes that within the given context, Uber provides the data subject – the Uber driver in the EEA – with extensive instructions on the provision of specific personal data. In addition, Uber drivers must comply with conditions set in advance by Uber with regard to the following: other the processing of their personal data in the context of a (pre)contractual employment relationship. Furthermore, Uber employees in the EEA, for example UBV employees, must adhere to Uber's internal policies that prescribe the mediation between the Uber driver and UTI. Uber also explained that if an Uber driver experiences problems, for example, when taking the mandatory profile photo for the driver app, the Uber driver can go to a Greenlight Hub location in the EEA where an employee assists the Uber driver (on site) in taking a photo with the Uber driver’s smartphone. The Uber driver can then upload the profile photo to the Uber IT platform operated by UTI, following the instructions of the employee. In this specific case, the personal data is technically transferred from the data subject’s personal device from the EEA to the Uber platform operated by UTI located in a third country. 
However, despite these processing activities instructed by Uber, which take place prior to and during the contractual relationship between the Uber driver and UBV, Uber attributes the continuous transfer of personal data from the EEA to a third country in situations 1 and 2 to the data subject.

88. The AP notes that Uber drivers provide their personal data by entering it on the Uber platform and that these are collected by Uber via the Uber driver’s personal device, within the EEA, and end up on Uber’s IT systems (operated by UTI) in the United States. This results in data flow of personal data from the EEA to the United States. 
In the opinion of AP, however, this does not mean that the transfer of data by Uber, as it took place and still takes place in accordance with the description of situations 1 and 2, does not concern transfers of personal data from UBV to UTI within the meaning of the GDPR. Uber uses the driver app as a technical tool to transfer the personal data from the EEA to the United States. UBV therefore bears joint responsibility and has (technical) control over the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States.

89. Furthermore, the AP is of the opinion that the question of whether there is an international transfer should not be assessed solely on the basis of the finding that it is the driver who operates the driver app via his private device. It should also be taken into account that Uber exercises a great deal of influence on the context in which those actions and the will of the driver are achieved. That context consists of various elements predetermined by Uber that in fact leave the driver no other choice than to enter the data in the Uber app. The following will explain which elements these are and how they determine the context in which the data transfers are achieved. It will become clear that the attribution of the transfer to the driver by Uber (who is only a link of minor importance in the entire process and the context of the processing) undermines the protection that the GDPR offers for the processing of personal data.

90. First, Uber’s modern business model, as well as its platform’s technical architecture and internal policies, are designed to serve Uber’s business purposes. In the present case, UBV, which enters into an agreement with Uber drivers (in the EEA), is considered to be the controller initiating the collection of personal data via the Uber platform in a pre-contractual employment relationship. At this stage, the drivers provide their personal data via their personal device, within the EEA, on the driver app platform operated by UTI, which is located outside the Union. From that moment on, Uber continuously collects and processes personal data via the Uber driver’s personal device. Subsequently, the personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA by means of transmission or otherwise made accessible to, and stored on, UTI's servers in the United States. The AP therefore establishes that in the contractual relationship between the Uber drivers within the EEA and UBV, UBV is the exporter of the personal data and UTI is the importer.

91. This view is consistent with 'providing effective and complete protection' of personal data which is required by the CJEU. Furthermore, this interpretation is not contrary to the Guidelines. The Guidelines provide several examples illustrating in which situations a processing operation should be considered a transfer. However, an example of a situation such as that which arises in the present case, in particular an example of an 'exporter' in the context of a (pre)contractual employment relationship, is not provided. In this case, the data subjects provide the personal data via their personal device on the platform operated by a third country entity, UTI. The contractual relationship between Uber drivers in the EEA and UBV – the terms of which are unilaterally determined in advance by Uber – enables Uber drivers in the EEA to access the Uber driver platform. The core activity, namely the provision of transport services on Uber’s platform, requires the Uber driver to upload personal data and Uber to continuously collect personal data from the Uber driver's device. The personal data will then be processed for various purposes jointly determined by UBV and UTI, involving transfers from the EEA to the United States.

92. The AP’s view, in which UBV is regarded as the 'exporter' and UTI as the 'importer', is further confirmed by the following details in the relationship between the Uber drivers and Uber (UBV and UTI).

- The Uber driver platform is set up by Uber in such a way that the Uber driver must enter his personal data on the platform via his personal device in order to access the platform, schedule activities (i.e. information events), receive support and provide transportation services. Uber also stipulates that the personal data of the drivers in the EU are processed on the UTI platform in a third country. The limited actual influence that Uber drivers have over their personal data vis-à-vis the controllers is an important factor in qualifying UBV as an exporter in the present case;

- With regard to the collection of personal data and/or otherwise processing of personal data of Uber drivers via the Uber platform by UBV and UTI, AP reiterates that the purposes and means of processing personal data are determined unilaterally by UBV and UTI. If a data subject decides to become an Uber driver in the EU, this requires an account on the Uber platform and then the acceptance of the general terms and conditions. By agreeing to the general terms and conditions, the Uber driver enters into a contract with UBV, which then subjects the Uber driver to the predetermined purposes and means of processing their personal data by UTI and UBV;

- The AP explicitly notes that although Uber drivers entered into the contract of their own free will, this does not automatically mean that they have any influence on determining the purposes and means of processing their own personal data. This is especially true since the general terms and conditions that Uber drivers must accept are drawn up in advance and are non-negotiable. Furthermore, Uber exercises full authority over the activities on the platform and the data processing resulting from these activities. For example, Uber influences certain aspects of the behaviour of Uber drivers by providing financial incentives to perform more rides and by having passengers rate their Uber driver, which can lead to the Uber driver being excluded from the platform.

---

93. The AP has also found that Uber has also exercised control in other ways through its platform about the behavior of Uber drivers and their personal data, namely:

- Uber drivers are controlled by an algorithm of the driver app that is predetermined by Uber and by means of which Uber exercises control over the data processing. In addition, Uber sets certain requirements that an Uber driver must meet. In order to demonstrate that these requirements are met, the Uber driver must upload documents with personal data to the platform.  
For example, as an Uber driver, one must own a car. The vehicles that are allowed to drive on behalf of Uber must meet certain requirements that seem to differ from country to country where Uber transport services are provided. The vehicles must be approved and meet the requirement of mandatory insurance. Furthermore, the driver must have a driving license and may not have a criminal record. These documents are assessed by UBV and UTI before an Uber driver is given permission and/or authorization to accept rides in his area.

- Based on the quality of the driver and the type of vehicle, the rates offered by Uber transportation services are divided into categories. The remaining amount is paid out to the Uber driver. In order to do this, the personal data of Uber drivers are processed by UTI and UBV.

- Uber enables passengers to access its platform and to perform the transport services in compliance with the general terms and conditions imposed by Uber, which are binding on the drivers by means of an agreement for the use of the platform. The terms and conditions apply to the acceptance and pursuit of activities and even to the behavior of drivers during the provision of the service. As described above, for example, the driver app contains a rating function that allows passengers to rate the drivers and vice versa. For this purpose, the passenger in question needs the personal data of his Uber driver so that he can rate the quality of the ride and other aspects of the ride provided by the Uber driver. An average rating that falls below the threshold could (previously) lead to exclusion from the platform, especially for drivers. Uber therefore exercises control over the quality of the services provided by its drivers. Uber cannot perform these activities without processing personal data. In particular, granting and refusing access to the platform requires personal data about the respective Uber driver.

- As mentioned earlier, Uber assigns different classifications to Uber drivers such as Gold, Platinum, or Diamond. In order to perform these activities for the purposes mentioned above, Uber keeps information about drivers.

- Drivers who make many trips are financially rewarded by Uber. Uber informs drivers where and when they can count on a large number of rides and/or preferential ride prices. Disagreements between a passenger and driver reported on the platform, for example about the ride price, are also handled by Uber. Uber can unilaterally decide to refund the ride price (in whole or in part) to the passenger, after which the driver will be paid a lower amount for the ride.

---

1.  Based on the above, it can be concluded that Uber’s activities in the EEA territory and beyond consist of offering rides in a vehicle that is located and booked through the platform. Providing this service is at the core of Uber’s business model. The service is also offered and perceived in this way by the ride seekers. When ride seekers decide to use the Uber platform, they are looking for a transport service that offers certain functions and a specific quality standard. Such aspects are predetermined and guaranteed by Uber. The AP therefore considers that Uber exercises control over important aspects of the transport service offered through its platform. This type of control includes, among other things, the collection and further processing of the personal data of Uber drivers in the EEA, including the transfer of their personal data to third countries.

---

95. In the present case, the AP expressly notes that the processing in question cannot be regarded as 'internal processing.' There are namely two controllers, UBV established in the EU and UTI established in the United States. These entities jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data of Uber drivers as described in situations 1 and 2. Furthermore, the data subjects in question have no control over these purposes and means of processing the personal data in question. The Uber drivers can therefore not be regarded as controllers within the meaning of the GDPR for the processing of personal data as described in situations 1 and 2.

96. Finally, the third criterion requires that “the importer is located in a third country (whether or not that importer is subject to the GDPR for the given processing activity under Article 3) or is an international organisation.”
In the present case, UTI is geographically located in the United States and imports the personal data of Uber drivers from the EEA to a third country within the meaning of the GDPR.

---

### 4.4.3 Conclusion

> 97. The AP concludes that the provisions on data transfer in Chapter V GDPR are complementary to Article 3 GDPR. Transfers of personal data between joint controllers falling under Article 3 are not excluded from the provisions of the GDPR on international transfers. This prevents the protection of personal data provided by EU law from being undermined or circumvented.

98. Secondly, it is sufficiently clear from Article 44 GDPR (and Recital 101 GDPR) that movement of personal data from the Union to an entity in a third country is a transfer. The AP determines that in this case there is a transfer within the meaning of Article 44 GDPR, because personal data from the EEA are transferred to the United States (a third country). The AP further notes that all criteria for transfer as set out in the Guidelines have also been met. The processing of personal data as described in situations 1 and 2 are thus considered transfers from the EEA to the United States.

99. The transfer by UBV to UTI means that the exporter, UBV, must comply with the obligations under the GDPR, including Chapter V GDPR. Finally, UBV must ensure that the data processed by the GDPR is guaranteed level of protection of natural persons is not undermined. In particular, UBV must assess whether the transfer instrument it intends to use is effective in light of the law and legal practice in force in the third country.

---

### 4.5 Did Uber have a transfer tool?

#### 4.5.1 Legal framework

100. Article 45, paragraph 1 GDPR provides: “A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer does not require any specific authorisation.

101. On 10 July 2023, the European Commission adopted the Adequacy Decision. This adequacy decision "has the effect that transfers from controllers and processors in the Union to certified organisations in the United States can take place without further consent. This is without prejudice to the direct application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to such entities, provided that the conditions for territorial application laid down in Article 3 of that Regulation are met.

102. Article 46(1) GDPR provides: "In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies are available to data subjects."

103. Article 46(2) GDPR provides that “the appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority, by the following instruments:
(a) a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies; (b) binding corporate rules pursuant to Article 47; (c) standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission pursuant to the procedures referred to in Article 93(2); investigation procedure; (d) standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority and adopted by the approved by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2); (e) a code of conduct approved in accordance with Article 40, together with binding and enforceable commitments by the controller or processor in the third country to apply appropriate safeguards, including as regards the rights of data subjects; or (f) an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42, together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply appropriate safeguards, including as regards the rights of data subjects.”

Article 46(3) GDPR provides that "subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, the appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be provided for, in particular, by:
(a) contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the controller, processor or recipient of the personal data in the third country or international organisation; or[…]

### 4.5.2 Assessment

104. Article 44 GDPR sets out the general principle on transfers, noting that the provisions of Chapter V should be applied to ensure that the level of protection guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined when personal data are transferred to a third country. Chapter V is also intended to ensure that the standard of protection under EU law is not circumvented as a result of transfers of personal data to a third country for processing there.

105. In the absence of an adequacy decision within the meaning of Article 45 GDPR, the transfer of personal data to the United States between 16 July 2020 and 10 July 2023 could only take place if appropriate safeguards were provided and data subjects had enforceable rights and effective legal remedies. The AP considers that these appropriate safeguards provided by the controller must ensure that the rights of data subjects whose data are transferred enjoy a level of protection essentially equivalent to that resulting from the GDPR, viewed in light of the Charter.

106. The EDPB states in its guidelines that “when one of the grounds referred to in Article 46 GDPR is invoked where a controller or processor transfers data to an importer in a third country whose processing falls within the scope of Article 3(2) GDPR, the protection afforded by the GDPR may also be undermined by the legal framework applicable to the importer.” The AP notes that where the GDPR is directly applicable on the basis of Article 3(1) GDPR, the same argumentation can be followed where one of the joint controllers is established outside the Union. The AP further notes that where personal data are processed within the EEA, they are protected not only by the provisions of the GDPR, but also by other EU and Member State legislation. Where personal data are transferred and/or made accessible to entities outside the EEA, the overarching legal framework provided within the Union no longer applies. In this regard, Chapter V of the GDPR provides a mechanism set up to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined. The data transfer mechanisms provide additional provisions to ensure the necessary safeguards to prevent the protection afforded by the GDPR and the broader EEA legal framework are undermined by foreign law, even where the GDPR is directly applicable by virtue of Article 3 GDPR.

107. The EDPB Guidelines further state that “this means that the exporter must comply with the conditions set out in Chapter V and use, when transferring, one of the instruments intended to protect the personal data after they have been transferred to a third country or an international organisation.”

108. The AP has determined that UBV did not have a legal right from August 6, 2021 to November 27, 2023 transfer mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. In response to the AP’s questions, Uber explains that “UBV and UTI previously entered into the controller-to-controller standard contractual clauses of the European Commission (‘SCCs’) in their joint controllership agreement.” Uber adds that “from the updated standard contractual clauses (‘SCC’) by the European Commission (‘EC’), it follows that standard contract clauses do not apply to a controller whose processing is subject to the GDPR. In light of this Uber revisited its joint controller agreement to delete the SCCs.” For this reason, Uber has removed the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries from its Data Sharing Agreement as of 6 August 2021.

109. The European Commission (EC) has stated in its FAQ that the new Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) cannot be used in a situation where the processing by controllers falls directly under the GDPR. Immediately after this, the EC notes that the “European Commission is in the process of developing an additional set of SCCs for this scenario, which will take into account the requirements that already apply directly to those controllers and processors under the GDPR.” The AP considers that Uber could in no case have inferred from these statements that SCCs or other transfer tools do not have to be used if the processing (in Uber’s view) falls under Article 3 GDPR. The EC’s statement therefore does not exempt Uber from compliance with the GDPR. Uber was and is currently obliged to use a transfer tool under Chapter V GDPR.

110. Uber should also have known, given its latest privacy statement, that a transfer mechanism was necessary. Uber has further stated: "In the event that the EU-U.S. DPF or the Swiss-U.S. DPF are invalidated, Uber will transfer data that is subject to these certifications in reliance on the other data transfer mechanisms described above."

---

### 4.5.3 Conclusion

> 111. The AP concludes that UBV (as exporter) did not have a lawful transfer mechanism in place for the transfer of personal data of drivers from the EEA to the United States from 6 August 2021 to 27 November 2023. The AP has not received any request from Uber regarding other suitable transfer instruments received under Article 46 GDPR.80 The AP therefore finds that Uber was in violation of Article 44 GDPR during the aforementioned period.

## 4.6 Can Uber successfully rely on an exception to Article 49 GDPR?
### 4.6.1 Legal framework

112. Article 7 of the Charter states that *“Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.”* Article 8(1) of the Charter states that *“Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.”* Processing personal data, as defined in Article 4(2) GDPR, of a data subject affects the fundamental right to respect for private life guaranteed in Article 7 of the Charter. Furthermore, such processing falls within the scope of Article 8 of the Charter. The AP notes that the rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights and must be considered in relation to their function in society. In addition to the above, Article 8(2) of the Charter states that personal data *“shall be processed fairly, for specified purposes and with the data subject’s consent or on some other legitimate basis provided for by law.”*

113. As regards the scope and interpretation of the rights enshrined in the Charter and principles, Article 52(1) of the Charter states that *“any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.”*

114. The derogations for specific situations set out in Article 49 GDPR state that *“in the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place only on one of the following conditions: […] b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject.”* 

115. Recital 111 of the GDPR states: *“Transfers should be possible in certain cases where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is occasional and necessary in connection with a contract or with legal proceedings, whether in a judicial or an administrative or out-of-court procedure, including before regulatory authorities.”*

116. The EDPB Guidelines 2/2018 on Derogations under Article 49 of Regulation 2016/679, adopted on 25 May 2018, state: *“The EDPB notes that Recital 111 uses the term ‘occasional’ and that the second subparagraph of Article 49(1) uses the term ‘not repetitive’ in the derogation based on ‘compelling legitimate interests’. These terms indicate that such transfers occur more than once - but not regularly - may occur and should not be part of the general approach, but, for example, under random, unknown circumstances and at irregular intervals. For example, a data transfer that occurs regularly within a stable relationship between the data exporter and a particular data importer may generally be considered systematic and repetitive, rather than occasional and non-repetitive.”*

#### 4.6.2 Assessment

117. The AP notes that the processing (including transfers) that takes place as described in situations 1 and 2 with regard to the personal data concerning the Uber drivers falls within the scope of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. These provisions guarantee the fundamental rights of the drivers. However, the AP notes that since these are not absolute rights, derogations that limit these rights are only permissible if they are in accordance with Article 52 of the Charter. According to Article 52 of the Charter, these rights may only be derogated from if:

118. *“Article 49 GDPR provides that in the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country may only take place if the conditions of Article 49 GDPR are met. The AP notes that the derogations in this article must be interpreted restrictively and may only be used where strictly necessary. After all, the derogations are intended for situations where there is no adequate protection in the country to which the data will be transferred, and where *“the risks for the data subjects are relatively small”* or because *“other interests”* outweigh the right to privacy of the (other) data subject. This principle is underlined in various provisions of Article 49 GDPR that impose restrictions on its use and the principle of derogations from fundamental rights under EU law. The restrictive use of this article is also supported by Article 49 GDPR title stating that the derogations may only be used for specific situations.

119. Furthermore, the AP notes that the use of Article 49 GDPR does not provide additional protection or guarantees for transfers of personal data that may lead to an increased risk with regard to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned. Furthermore, the AP notes that where the transfer takes place on the basis of a derogation, the relevant provisions of the GDPR still apply. Finally, Article 49 GDPR must be read in light of the Charter.

120. Uber has indicated that if the AP concludes that processing operations are taking place that must be regarded as transfers within the meaning of Chapter V GDPR, Uber could base the processing operations described for situation 1 on Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b) GDPR. According to Uber, the processing operations described for situation 2 could be based on Article 49, paragraph 1, sub c) GDPR. Below, the AP assesses Uber’s reliance on these two grounds for exception in their respective order.

---

### The transfers are not incidental

121. According to Recital 111 of the GDPR, this derogation may only be used if the transfer is occasional. As indicated in the EDPB Guidelines, it excludes transfers that *“take place regularly within a stable relationship”* and cannot apply *“to many transfers within the business relationship”*. Any other interpretation would be inconsistent with EU law, which requires that a derogation from a fundamental right is not interpreted in a way that contradicts its exceptional nature.

122. The AP notes that the contractual necessity derogation of Article 49(1)(b) GDPR cannot be relied upon to justify transfer activities as described for situation 1. This is because the transfers of data of more than [confidential] Uber drivers between UBV and UTI are considered systematic, repetitive and continuous. In this regard, the AP notes in accordance with the EDPB Guidelines that in light of recital 111, one should only rely on Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b, c and e for strictly necessary, occasional transfers.

> 123. Uber has indicated that the AP’s explanation is incorrect and incompatible with Article 49 GDPR. Uber substantiates her positions by appealing to the non-binding nature of the considerations of the GDPR. Uber argues that the 'occasional' criterion is not laid down in Article 49 GDPR. According to Uber, the wording of Article 49(1) GDPR, which provides that the derogations may be used in specific situations for a 'transfer' or 'series of transfers', does not imply that the provision can be interpreted in such a way that 'occasional' is part of the criteria to be met.

124. The AP agrees with Uber that the recital has no binding legal force and that it cannot be relied on as a basis for deviating from actual legal provisions or in the event that provisions are interpreted in such a way that they clearly conflict with the wording of the provision. However, the AP notes that the recitals to the GDPR *“can explain the content of the provisions of that law”* and that they *“contain important elements of interpretation that can clarify the intentions of the person who drafted the law.”* More importantly, the CJEU supports this interpretation in its case law, where it explained the limits to the scope of the derogation in light of the recitals. More specifically, the CJEU considers that, in order to interpret a provision of EU law, it is necessary to look not only at its wording but also at *“the context in which it occurs and the objective pursued by the rules of which it forms part”* and that *“the scope of the derogation … must be determined in the light of the interpretation thus provided by the EU legislature.”* The CJEU also held that an interpretation of the derogation without taking into account the intention of the EU legislature as reflected in the recitals would undermine the purpose of the legislation. 
> The AP therefore finds that recital 111 to the GDPR provides the necessary clarification for the interpretation of Article 49(1)(b) GDPR in accordance with the objectives pursued by the EU legislature and furthermore finds that the recital is not contrary to the wording of the aforementioned article. Any other interpretation of this article would disregard the intention of the legislator and be contrary to the approach taken by the CJEU. The AP therefore arrives at the conclusion that only Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b GDPR can be relied on to justify 'incidental' transfers.

> 125. With regard to the processing described for situation 1, UBV cannot rely in the present case on the derogation from Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b GDPR to justify the transfer to the United States. After all, the AP qualifies that transfer as systematic, repetitive and continuous in a stable, ongoing business relationship between UBV and UTI.

126. As regards the processing operations in situation 2, Uber indicates that these can be based on Article 49(1)(c) GDPR. Under this derogation, a transfer or a series of transfers may take place where "the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person." The condition that the transfer must be necessary and occasional also applies to this provision. In the present case, UBV cannot use the derogation as a basis for a transfer, because this transfer is also considered to be systematic and repetitive in nature within a stable, ongoing business relationship between UBV and UTI. Moreover, Uber has a legal obligation to facilitate data subject rights not under the contract, but under the GDPR.

### The transfers are not necessary

127. In addition to the fact that there is no incidental transfer, Uber cannot successfully rely on Article 49 paragraph 1 sub b and c GDPR, because the transfer is not necessary for the performance of a contract between Uber and the data subject or between Uber and a third party (a contract in the interest of the data subject).

128. In this context, the AP recalls that the necessity requirement, as an autonomous Union concept, requires that the processing must be objectively indispensable to enable the conclusion of the contract.106 It is irrelevant whether the processing is useful for the contract or is mentioned therein,107 but the controller must demonstrate that the main purpose of the contract could not be achieved without that processing.108 The necessity link must, as Uber itself rightly indicates, be close and substantial in relation to the purpose of the contract.

129. An example of necessity is where a data transfer takes place from a travel agency to a hotel in a third country in order to enter into a contract between the customer and the travel agency. In this case, the link between the transfer and the purpose is close and substantial, and there is no realistic alternative (after all, hotels are often located in third countries). An example of a lack of necessity is where a group of companies transfers its data for business purposes, payment functions and HR policies for all its staff in a third country, as there is no objective link between the performance of the contract and the transfer.

130. Uber explained the necessity in the present case by first pointing out that the transfer takes place in the context of the agreements (Data Sharing Agreement) between UBV in the EU and UTI in the US. In the opinion of the AP, this does not make the transfer necessary, precisely because the Court has ruled that the mere existence of the agreement itself (the 'mentioning') cannot constitute necessity. According to the Court, for necessity to be assumed, there must be 'no usable, less intrusive alternatives' and the controller must be able to demonstrate this.

131. Secondly, Uber considers that the centralised processing of data in the US is crucial for the provision of Uber services and for guaranteeing the right of drivers in the EU to protection of their personal data: 'only by processing personal data centrally can Uber apply its extensive technical and organisational measures worldwide and offer drivers the highest level of protection'. Uber has failed to make this sufficiently clear to the AP why the transfer of personal data to the US is crucial for the provision of the service and a high level of protection. As stated in paragraph 128, firstly, there is a lack of necessity if a group of companies centralises personal data in a third country for business purposes. 
> In this case, the personal data could also have been processed on a server in the EU if a third country does not provide an adequate level of protection. Secondly, in almost every conceivable case, it seems that a transfer to a country without an adequate level of protection would actually undermine the level of protection provided by the GDPR.

132. Perhaps unnecessarily, although Uber indicated in its written statement that the transfer is crucial for both the provision of the services and the provision of a higher level of data protection, Uber's explanation during the hearing suggests that other motives were at play. Uber stated that the choice for centralised processing in the US was motivated by the fact that the service can be provided more quickly and efficiently in this way. This suggests that centralized processing in the US appears to be motivated for reasons much more akin to its efficiency.

133. In summary, the AP is of the opinion that Uber has not demonstrated why the transfer is objectively necessary for the performance of the agreement and that there are no usable, less intrusive alternatives available. An appeal to Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b and c GDPR therefore also fails for this reason.


### 4.6.3 Conclusion

134. The AP concludes that Uber cannot successfully rely on the derogations (exceptions) for specific situations in relation to international transfers as referred to in Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b and c GDPR for the period from 6 August 2021 to 27 November 2023.

## 4.7 Final conclusion

135. The AP is of the opinion that there is processing in which personal data of Uber drivers from the EEA are processed by Uber. In addition, there is a transfer of personal data as referred to in the GDPR. In the absence of an adequacy decision, within the meaning of Article 45 GDPR, the transfer of personal data to the United States between 16 July 2020 and 10 July 2023 could only take place if appropriate safeguards were provided and data subjects had enforceable rights and effective legal remedies. The AP has determined that UBV did not provide the necessary appropriate safeguards described in Article 46, paragraph 2 GDPR at least between 6 August 2021 and 27 November 2023. Furthermore, UBV cannot (given the unnecessary and structural nature of the processing) successfully rely on the exceptions described in Article 49, paragraph 1, sub b and c GDPR. The AP therefore finds that Uber was in violation of Article 44 GDPR during the aforementioned period.

# 5. The fine

## 5.1 Authority to impose fines and Uber's point of view

136. Uber has put forward several grounds relating to the lack of justification for the imposition by the AP of an administrative fine or corrective measure. Firstly, Uber states that the investigation report was drafted inadequately and carelessly. Secondly, according to Uber, the lex certa principle and the fact that there is a prospect of concrete legalisation (by the EU-US DPF) preclude enforcement by the AP. Thirdly, according to Uber, referring to case C-807/21 of the CJEU, an administrative fine can only be imposed if there is intent or negligence and a corrective measure is not appropriate. Finally, Uber states that a measure may have disproportionate consequences and that Uber should therefore be given the opportunity to submit a separate opinion on the possible sanction decision when it has more clarity about it.

137. The AP does not follow Uber's argument. The AP is of the opinion that, based on the facts and the assessments based on them, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that personal data is being transferred and that the violation was committed by Uber. Where necessary, the AP has reviewed the facts and assessments supplemented in response to Uber's view. With regard to Uber's appeal to the lex certa principle, which is contained in, among other things, Article 49 of the Charter, the AP considers the following. As the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State has considered on several occasions,113 payment functions and HR policies for all its staff in a third country, as there is no objective link between the performance of the contract and the transfer.109

138. The AP concludes that this is the case in this case. According to the AP, the provisions it tested are sufficiently clear. Based on Chapter V of the GDPR, the considerations in the GDPR, the case law on transfers of the ECJ and also previous decisions of other European privacy supervisors, it was foreseeable for Uber that a transfer instrument would be necessary for the transfer of personal data to the United States (as a third country). The fact that Uber had itself certified under the new adequacy decision on 27 November 2023 does not affect the AP’s authority to take enforcement action for the period of two years and three months during which Uber did not have a transfer instrument. Based on the facts and the assessments based thereon, it has therefore been established beyond reasonable doubt that the infringement was committed by Uber.

139. The AP has, on the basis of Article 58, paragraph 2, opening sentence and under i, in conjunction with Article 83 of the GDPR and read in conjunction with Article 14, paragraph 3, of the GDPR Implementation Act, the power to impose an administrative fine. In this context, the CJEU first specified that a condition for the imposition of such a fine is that the infringement was culpably committed by the offender. This includes intentional or negligent conduct. A controller has committed an infringement intentionally or through negligence if he could not have been unaware that his conduct constituted an infringement, regardless of whether he was aware that he was violating the provisions of the GDPR, as follows from the case law of the CJEU.115

140. The AP has determined that Uber has committed a violation of Article 44 GDPR. Uber could have known on the basis of the GDPR and the case law of the ECJ that a transfer instrument is necessary for the transfer of personal data to the United States. Due to this violation and its seriousness, the AP sees reason to use its authority to impose an administrative fine.

## 5.2 Systematics of determining the amount of the fine

142. The EDPB approved the final text of the Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (hereinafter: the Guidelines). The AP will apply these Guidelines to this case.117 The (national) policy rules of the AP on determining the amount of administrative fines have been withdrawn, insofar as relevant at this time.118

143. The Guidelines describe a methodology that considers in turn:

1. To map the processing activities in the case concerned and to evaluate the application of Article 83(3) GDPR;
2. Determine the starting amount for further calculation;
3. or there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances that require an adjustment of the amount in step 2;
4. what maximum amounts apply to the violations and whether any increases from the previous step do not exceed this amount;
5. whether the final amount of the fine calculated meets the requirements of effectiveness, deterrence and proportionality and, if necessary, is adjusted accordingly.

144. These steps are followed in turn below.

## 5.3 Calculation of fine amount

### 5.3.1 Step 1: Determining actions and violations

145. In order to determine the starting amount of the fine, it must first be determined, as described in the Guidelines, whether there is one or more sanctionable conduct.

146. The AP has found that there is a deficiency in one of the transfer instruments such as laid down in Chapter V GDPR. Uber has thereby breached the obligation under Article 44 GDPR to use a transfer tool for international transfers. The calculation of the starting amount in this case relates to two processing operations that fall within the context of one sanctionable conduct.

### 5.3.2 Step 2: Determine starting amount

147. As described in the Guidelines, the starting amount of the fine must then be determined. This starting amount forms the basis for the further calculation in subsequent steps, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The Guidelines state that the starting amount is determined on the basis of three elements: (i) the classification of the infringements under Article 83(4) to (6) GDPR; (ii) the gravity of the infringement and (iii) the turnover of the undertaking. All three elements are discussed below.

#### Ad i) Classification of infringements according to Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6, of the GDPR

148. As stated in the Guidelines, almost all obligations of the controller are categorised in the provisions of Article 83 paragraphs 4 to 6 GDPR. The GDPR distinguishes between two types of infringements. On the one hand, infringements that are sanctionable under Article 83 paragraph 4 GDPR, and for which a maximum fine of € 10 million applies (or in the case of an undertaking, 2% of the annual turnover, whichever is higher), on the other hand, infringements that are sanctionable under Article 83 paragraphs 5 and 6 GDPR, and for which a maximum fine of € 20 million applies (or in the case of an undertaking, 4% of the annual turnover, whichever is higher). With this distinction, the legislator has provided an initial indication of the seriousness of the infringement: the more serious the infringement, the higher the fine.

149. An administrative fine of € 149.00 may be imposed for the current violation of Article 44 GDPR. A maximum of €20,000,000.00 (or in the case of a company, 4% of the worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher). From this categorisation it follows that the infringement of these provisions is considered serious by the legislator (in abstracto).

#### Ad ii) Gravity of the infringement

150. In determining the seriousness of the infringement, account shall be taken of the 1) nature, 2) gravity and 3) duration of the infringement, as well as the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement and the categories of personal data concerned.

151. The nature of the infringement must be assessed in relation to the interest that the breached provision aims to protect. The AP finds that the intended interest of Article 44 GDPR, namely the continuity of the high level of protection of the GDPR when transferring personal data to third countries, has not been guaranteed by Uber. Due to the lack of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards during the period of the infringement, Uber unlawfully transferred personal data to a third party.

152. In assessing the seriousness of the infringement, the AP considers the following. With regard to the nature of the processing, it is first relevant to examine the relationship between the controller and the data subjects. The AP notes that in this case there is a hierarchical working relationship between Uber and the drivers.119 
> The AP notes, as described in paragraph 4.3.2, that Uber's actual working method with regard to its drivers is also based on a high degree of dependency. Uber itself also confirms this in its written statement by stating that the drivers "depend on the income they receive through the Uber Rides driver app for their daily livelihood".120 Secondly, the nature of the processing entails higher risks, because Uber evaluates personal aspects of drivers and makes decisions about them.

153. With regard to the scope of the processing, the AP finds that there is cross-border processing within the meaning of Article 4, section 23, GDPR. Uber processes personal data of drivers from various EU countries. This makes Uber's processing extensive.

154. As regards the purpose of the processing, the AP notes that the more central the place of the processing within the core activities of the controller, the more serious irregularities in that processing will be.121 In this assessment, processing in the context of generating rides must be distinguished from the handling of access requests. As regards the processing of personal data in the context of generating rides, the AP notes that this is an essential part of Uber's core activity, namely mediating as a platform between drivers offering rides and customers requesting rides. Without generating rides, it is not possible to suggest rides to drivers, and for them to accept and offer them to customers. As regards the processing of personal data for the purpose of handling access requests, the AP notes that this does not form part of Uber's core activity, because Uber is merely attempting to comply with a legal obligation arising from the GDPR. It does not independently contribute to Uber's revenue model as a commercial enterprise.

155. With regard to the number of affected data subjects, the AP found that from 6 August 2021 to mid-February 2023, there were an average of [confidential] drivers active for Uber in France and an average of [confidential] drivers in the entire EU. On 17 February 2023, there were [confidential] active drivers in the EU according to Uber. Regarding transfers in the context of data subject access requests, Uber executed [confidential] data subject access requests between August 2021 and February 2023 with the automatic download tool from EU drivers. Uber has also executed [confidential] removal requests for (former) drivers from the EU. Finally, Uber indicates that in addition to the download tool, Uber processed [confidential] requests from French (former) drivers for a more extensive access request between August 6, 2021 and February 1, 2023. In addition, Uber states in its written response that, in the context of handling access requests by telephone and letter, fewer than ten requests are processed per year. Some requests are too complex and have to be prepared manually by an employee of Uber BV; this concerns approximately 100 requests in the first four months of 2023.

156. The AP further found in paragraph 2.5 that the infringement took place from 6 August 2021 to 27 November 2023. That is two years and more than three months. This is a considerable period. In the opinion of the AP, Uber committed the conduct culpably. The infringement ceased to exist on 27 November 2023, because Uber certified itself under the EU-US DPF on that date.

157. Finally, it must be determined whether Uber has processed personal data that requires special protection and therefore lead to a higher severity of the infringement. The amount of data collected about each data subject must also be taken into account. As the AP determined in section 2.3, Uber processes a large amount of data about Uber drivers. In addition to account data, location data, photos, proof of payment and reviews, Uber also processes (depending on the legal rules in a country) other data, such as identity documents, criminal and health data. Much of this data is sensitive by nature. In addition, criminal and health data are special personal data that enjoy additional protection under Articles 9 and 10 GDPR. In particular, the AP charges Uber with the transfer of criminal data to the United States, where it was determined at the time that this country could not offer an adequate level of protection, and where it was known that government agencies could gain access to personal data stored there. For the above reasons, the AP considers the influence of this aspect to increase the overall severity of the infringement.

#### Ad iii) Turnover of the company

158. The Guidelines provide that, for reasons of fairness, the starting amount of the fine should be related to the size of the company. The size of the company is determined on the basis of the turnover. For example, for a small company with a turnover of up to €2 million, the starting amount is generally limited to 0.2 to 0.4% of the actual starting amount, and the starting amount increases as the turnover of the company increases. If a company has a turnover of more than €500 million, the amount of the fine is determined as a percentage of the annual turnover of the company.122 As a result, the size and turnover of the company are already discounted in the amount of the fine, so that the starting amount does not need to be adjusted on that basis.

159. As stated in recital 150 of the GDPR, when imposing a fine on an undertaking, the “undertaking” must be regarded as an undertaking within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It follows from settled case-law of the CJEU that an undertaking is any entity carrying out an economic activity, irrespective of its legal status and the way in which it is financed. It is therefore the economic unit of the undertaking that is relevant, and not the legal entities within it. Several companies or entities within the same economic unit may therefore together constitute an undertaking within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions.

160. Uber BV is indirectly a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber Technologies Inc. They must therefore be considered to be part of the same undertaking for the purposes of Article 83 of the GDPR.

161. As stated in the Guidelines, turnover can be determined on the basis of the company’s annual accounts for the previous financial year. Under Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6, GDPR, the worldwide turnover in the previous financial year is taken into account.

162. Uber Technologies Inc. has published its 2023 annual accounts on its website.123 A consolidated overview of the company is included on page 75. It shows that the company’s global turnover for 2023 amounts to $37.281 billion. This corresponds to €34.235 billion.124

#### Determine starting amount

163. Under Article 83, paragraph 5, of the GDPR, the maximum fine is 4% of the annual turnover. The annual turnover is €34.235 billion, so the maximum fine for the infringement is €1.369 billion.

164. The assessment of the above circumstances and factors determines the overall seriousness of the infringement committed by Uber. This involves a thorough assessment of the specific circumstances of the case in which all circumstances must be viewed together.

165. In view of the considerations under i) and ii), the AP takes the position that the level of severity of the infringement must be qualified as “high”. According to the Guidelines, for infringements with a high level of seriousness, the starting amount should be set at a point between 20% and 100% of the maximum fine of €1.369 billion in this case. This corresponds to an amount between €273.881 million and €1.369 billion. The general rule is that the more serious the infringement within its own category, the higher the starting amount will be.

166. The AP is of the opinion that, given the circumstances described, the infringement is serious. However, the AP does not consider all circumstances to be so serious or negative that the starting amount should be set at the upper limit of the maximum fine. In this regard, the AP has taken into account, among other things, the number of affected parties and the fact that the infringement has ended.

167. Based on the categorisation of the infringement, the gravity of the infringement and the turnover of the company, the AP sets the starting amount for the infringement of Article 44 GDPR in this case at €290 million.

### 5.3.3 Step 3: Assess other relevant circumstances
168. As stated in the Guidelines, it must then be considered whether the circumstances of the case warrant setting the fine higher or lower than the starting amount determined above. The circumstances to be taken into account are listed in Article 83, paragraph 2, introductory phrase and points (a) to (k) of the GDPR. Each of the circumstances listed in that provision must be considered only once. The previous step has already taken into account the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement (part (a)), the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (part (b)) and the categories of personal data (part (g)). This leaves parts (c) to (f) and (h) to (k).

169. The only applicable circumstance is the manner in which the AP became aware of the infringement, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller notified the infringement (part h). In this case, Uber did not notify the infringements itself, but they came to the AP’s attention through complaints. However, according to the Guidelines, this is assessed as “neutral” and therefore has no consequences for the amount of the fine to be imposed.

### 5.3.4 Step 4: Checking whether the maximum amounts applicable to the infringements are exceeded

170. As mentioned, the maximum fine for the violation - also taking into account Uber’s turnover - is 4% of the company’s global annual turnover. The annual turnover is €34.235 billion, so the maximum fine for the violation is €1.369 billion.

171. Based on the above considerations, the AP determines the fine amount for the observed infringement set at €290 million. This is below the statutory maximum so that it will not be exceeded.

### 5.3.5 Step 5: Assessment of requirements of effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence

172. Finally, it must be assessed whether the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In addition, the administrative fine may not lead to a disproportionate outcome given the circumstances of the case.

173. The Guidelines provide that the imposition of an administrative fine may be considered effective if it achieves the purpose for which it was imposed. The purpose may be to punish unlawful conduct as well as to promote compliance with applicable regulations. Given the above considerations regarding the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, as well as the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of Article 83, paragraph 2, GDPR, the AP is of the opinion that the administrative fine in question achieves both objectives and is therefore effective and dissuasive.

174. The AP further considers that the imposition of the fine and its amount are not disproportionate, given the seriousness of the violation and the size of the company. Uber stated in its opinion that the imposition of an administrative fine would have disproportionate consequences for Uber, because any notification of the fine to the New York Stock Exchange could have significant consequences for the price of Uber's shares. However, the AP sees no reason to consider the fine disproportionate. Although it is not excluded that the fine could have some influence on the price of Uber's shares, it has not been made plausible that this would have such an influence that the fine should be considered disproportionate. It is also important that the amount of the fine is sufficiently deterrent and does justice to the nature and seriousness of the violation. In the opinion of the AP, no other special circumstances have occurred in this context that would make the fine disproportionate.

175. The AP additionally notes the following with regard to the AP Fine Policy Rules 2019. If the AP had to impose a fine on the basis of this policy, the AP would have seen reason to apply Article 8.4 of the AP Fine Policy Rules 2019, given Uber's global turnover and therefore its large size as an offender. Determining fine amounts within the fine range of the AP Fine Policy Rules 2019 would not in that case lead to an appropriate punishment that would be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The conclusion is that the AP would have imposed a fine of the same amount under the Fine Policy Rules 2019.
