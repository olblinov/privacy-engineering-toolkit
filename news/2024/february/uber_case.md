Decision to impose an administrative fine on Uber

Dear 	,

The Dutch Data Protection Authority (hereinafter: AP) is of the opinion that Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV (hereinafter together: Uber) have committed a number of violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with regard to transparency. This concerns offering the guidance notes to drivers only in the English language and not providing information in an easily accessible form in response to a request for access, which is contrary to Article 12(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the digital form that allows drivers to exercise their right of access and data portability is not easily accessible in the driver app, which is in violation of Article 12(2) of the GDPR. The information about the retention periods in the privacy statement is also not sufficiently specific (Article 13, second paragraph, opening words and (a) and Article 15, first paragraph, (d) of the GDPR) and the information about transfers is not complete and meaningful enough ( Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f) of the GDPR). Finally, Uber has not explicitly mentioned the right to data portability in the privacy statement (Article 13(2)(b) of the GDPR).

For committing these violations, the AP reports to Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV jointly imposed administrative fines totaling €10,000,000.00 .

# 1. Reason for research

Uber is an internationally operating company that, among other things, acts as an intermediary between taxi drivers and passengers. Passengers use the general Uber App (for mobile phones) or possibly a browser, drivers use the Uber Driver App (hereinafter: driver app).

To use the driver app, creating an account for drivers is mandatory. After a ride, drivers are assessed by their customers and paid by Uber for the services provided.

Uber has set up a digital form, accessible via the Uber website and via the driver app, that drivers can use to submit requests for access and data portability regarding their personal data. Uber has also drawn up a privacy statement, with which Uber provides insight into the processing of personal data by Uber.

On June 12, 2020, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) received a complaint from the French non-governmental organization Ligue Des Droits De L'homme Et Du Citoyen (LDH) on behalf of 21 Uber drivers. Gradually, another 151 Uber drivers joined the complaint, so that it was filed on behalf of 172 complainants. On September 29, 2020, the LDH filed an additional complaint with the CNIL. The complaints were forwarded by the CNIL to the AP, after which the AP's International Investigation Department started an investigation and prepared a report.


# 2. Findings of research report

The report identifies 5 violations regarding transparency, namely:

The digital form with which an access request can be made is not easily accessible in the driver app (Article 12(2) GDPR).
In response to a request for access, Uber provides a copy of the personal data in a form that is not easily accessible, and the accompanying guidance notes are not in a language (English) that (French) drivers can understand (Article 12(1) GDPR).
Uber does not provide sufficiently specific information about the retention periods in the privacy statement (Art. 13 (2) (a) GDPR and Art. 15 (1) (a) and (d) GDPR).
In the privacy statement, Uber does not specifically mention the names of the countries to which data transfers take place or the specific protection measures (Art. 13 (1) (f) GDPR and Art. 15 (2) GDPR).

Uber does not explicitly mention the right to data portability/data portability in its privacy statement (Art. 13, 2, b, GDPR).

The International Investigation Department concluded in the investigation report that Uber committed the above violations from May 25, 2018 up to and including the date of adoption of the investigation report (June 30, 2022). The investigation report and the intention to enforce were sent to Uber on July 8, 2022. Uber provided its written opinion on the investigation report and its intention to enforce it in a letter dated September 15, 2022. On January 12, 2023, Uber orally explained its view. A report has been drawn up (annex to this decision).

In accordance with Article 60 GDPR, the AP has submitted the draft decision to the relevant supervisory authorities.

# 3. Legal framework

The AP refers to the appendix to this decision, which contains the legal framework.

# 4. Assessment

## 4.1 	Controller and authority of AP

Uber BV is the Dutch branch of Uber, Uber Technologies Inc. is located in the United States and is the parent company of, among others, Uber BV. Jointly established by Uber BV and Uber Technologies Inc. the purposes and means of the processing of personal data of Uber drivers in the European Economic Area (EEA). The (French) drivers have an agreement with Uber BV. For requests regarding the rights of data subjects, the rough division is that Uber BV is responsible for assessing such requests and that Uber Technologies Inc. makes the technical resources and data available. Uber Technologies Inc. is also the publisher of the driver app.

In Uber's privacy statement, Uber BV and Uber Technologies Inc. also designated as a joint controller. The joint processing responsibility has not been disputed by Uber.

Uber offers its services in several EU member states and Uber processes personal data for these services. This means that data subjects in more than one Member State are materially affected by the processing of personal data by Uber. This constitutes cross-border processing (Article 4, opening words and 23 (a) and (b) GDPR). Because Uber's central administration in the EEA is located at Uber BV, Uber BV is regarded as its principal place of business within the meaning of Article 4, opening words and paragraph 16, GDPR. The AP is competent to act as the lead supervisory authority (Article 56(1) GDPR).

## 4.2 Accessibility of the form for access requests

The research report found that the digital form that allows drivers to exercise their right of access and data portability is **not easily accessible in the driver app because there are too many steps to go through and the wording** of the steps does not intuitively lead to the form. Uber therefore does not sufficiently facilitate the exercise of the aforementioned rights of data subjects and violates Article 12, paragraph 2, GDPR.

### Uber's view

Uber indicates that neither the GDPR, legislative history, case law, applicable guidelines and directives nor authoritative commentary indicate exactly how many actions a data subject may perform to make an access or transfer request. This also applies to the AP's argument that a data subject must be able to reach a page intuitively. Under Article 12(2) of the GDPR, Uber has a certain amount of freedom to determine how it facilitates the right of access and data portability. The AP further introduces a new standard without substantiation by stating that the form must be “sufficiently easy” to find, according to Uber.

In Guidelines 1, the EDPB explains the transparency obligations in such a way that they can be met by using a “layered information structure”. The drivers can therefore be expected to go through several steps. This is also the benchmark in consumer law. Drivers use the menu in the app every day and a reasonable and average driver will be able to find the form without any difficulty, even if it means clicking through six times. In addition, Uber points out that the driver app is made for a smartphone with a small screen. Uber wants to prevent drivers from having to scroll through long menus when using the app and has therefore opted for menu paths.

Uber then indicates that the AP recognizes that Uber offers several ways to submit an access or transfer request, but according to Uber, the AP wrongly only looked at the ways that Uber offers in the driver app. The AP also wrongly ignored the route that links via the driver app to the privacy statement on the website. Uber disputes the number of steps that the AP counted to get to the form: Uber uses a different count and arrives at a lower number of steps.

Regarding the wording of the different steps, Uber indicates that “more obvious” is not an existing criterion in the GDPR and that it is subjective which route is the most obvious. Positioning the form higher under a “privacy” heading comes at the expense of other menu options. Since February 2022, Uber has made adjustments to the routes in the driver app to the form, but these adjustments have not been included in the research report.

### Judgement

In the version of the driver app assessed in the report, the following steps must be completed, schematically, to access the form to submit a request for access or data portability: Menu > Help > Account and app issues > Legal concerns > Request your personal Uber data> Submit a privacy inquiry > log in via “Sign in to get help” or “Submit a privacy inquiry without an Uber account” after which the driver will arrive at the form (route 1). The report also describes a route that opens the privacy statement on Uber's website via a link, where a link can also be clicked to “submit a privacy inquiry” (route 2) 2 . This route has not been taken into account in the report, because Uber must at least facilitate drivers in their rights via the driver app (and in route 2 the app transfers to Uber's website).

The research found that the main interaction between Uber and drivers takes place through the driver app 3 . For this reason, the AP is of the opinion that, at least in the driver app, drivers must be facilitated in exercising their rights within the meaning of Article 12(2) GDPR. In accordance with Recital 59 of the GDPR, arrangements should be in place to enable the data subject to exercise their rights more easily. This means that the arrangements must be in line with the ways in which those involved interact. 4 The fact that Uber also offers drivers the opportunity to submit a request for access or data portability through other means does not alter the fact that drivers should at least be facilitated in the driver app in exercising their rights. The AP is of the opinion that route 2 to the request form was wrongly ignored in the investigation report, because the privacy statement on the website is automatically opened via the driver app and this does not detract from the facilitation of making a request. request. The routes described by Uber in its opinion that have been introduced in the driver app since February 2022 were also incorrectly not included in the study because they do fall within the period examined. This concerns the route changed by Uber: Menu > Help > legal, ethics and compliance > request your personal Uber data > log in or “Submit a privacy inquiry after which the driver will arrive at the form (route 3). In this context, Uber has also pointed out the introduction of the Privacy Center was introduced across Europe on February 17, 2022. The steps via the Privacy Center are as follows: Account security and privacy> privacy center > Would you like a copy of your personal data? > log in or “Submit a privacy inquiry without an account” after which the driver will arrive at the form (route 4). In addition, Uber points out a fifth route via the Privacy Statement.

With regard to the number of steps to be taken in the various routes to reach the request form, the AP considers the following. It follows from recital 59 of the GDPR that when facilitating, the convenience for the data subject in exercising his rights must be taken into account. The AP Schematically shown: up to and including “legal concerns” the same route as route 1 > Privacy notice information > Privacy Notice (select the correct language and jurisdiction) and then you will arrive at the privacy statement in which you can click on a link to “submit a privacy inquiry”.

Marginal numbers 30 to 32 of the research report endorses Uber's position that using a layered information structure can make it easier for those involved to find information under certain circumstances. This is the case with the driver app, which will often be used on smartphones with a screen of limited size, and in which a relatively large amount of information (on various subjects) is offered. At the same time, with a layered information structure, the ability of those involved to find information should not be hindered by having to click through unnecessarily often. A balance will therefore have to be found between the number of actions to be completed and the amount of information provided per "step". Moreover, the wording of the steps to be followed must be facilitating, which means that the person concerned must be guided simply and therefore without further ado to the desired request form. Adequate wording of the various steps to the form is indispensable in connection with the obligation to facilitate. Placing (the route to) the request form with which drivers can exercise their rights under the GDPR under “Help”, “Account and app issues” or “Account” and “Legal concerns” or “Legal, ethics, and compliance” In the opinion of the AP, this is not obvious. The AP considers direct placement under, for example, “Privacy” to be simple and straightforward. With regard to routes 1 and 2, the AP is of the opinion that the combination of the number of steps to be completed and their wording create such a high barrier for those involved that Uber does not sufficiently facilitate its drivers. In the opinion of the AP, this constitutes a violation of Article 12, paragraph 2, of the GDPR.

However, the AP is of the opinion that this violation has been ended with effect from February 17, 2022 by the introduction of the Privacy Center, which contains route 4 described above. By creating a logical place with a clear name, Uber facilitates its drivers in exercising their right to access and data portability.

## 4.3 Response to request for access: form and language

The AP has established that Uber provides information in a CSV file in response to a request for access, without providing information about how the information from such a file can be structured. By not providing the information in an easily accessible form, Uber violates Article 12(1) GDPR. In addition, the AP has determined that Uber violates Article 12(1) of the GDPR by providing the guidance notes, in which Uber provides further explanations about the values in the CSV files when supplying the information, only in English. This violation affects not only French drivers, but almost all Uber drivers in Europe.

### Form: Uber's view

Uber states that the GDPR does not specifically prescribe which form meets the 'easily accessible' standard or on the basis of which criteria this can be determined. The explanation in Guidelines 5 also makes the standard little concrete, and the AP cannot base a violation of the GDPR on the guidelines alone. According to Uber on its website, the AP agrees that the GDPR does not prescribe how information should be provided. CSV is a very suitable file format for provision of information, because, unlike, for example, a PDF format, further analysis of the data is possible. Uber also states that the benchmark should be the 'reasonable and average data subject', and according to this benchmark, the CSV files that Uber provides are easily accessible. Uber argues that CSV is a universal file format and will in principle be opened automatically by Windows and Apple operating systems in software that can display tables. Even if that is not the case, Uber meets the 'easily accessible' standard because the person concerned can then easily adjust the display of the file, possibly after consulting a search engine for instructions. Even when a CSV file opens in a text file, the information within it is still easily accessible. By mandating that Uber provide information in CSV format with explanations about how to open a file in many different software applications, the AP is introducing a new standard.

### Form: review

The AP states that it is not of the opinion that the 'easily accessible' standard of Article 12(1) GDPR cannot be met by providing information in a CSV file. Guidelines 6 state the following about 'easily accessible': 'The element “easily accessible” means that the data subject does not have to search for that information himself; it must be immediately clear to the person concerned where and how this information can be found.' For information provided in response to a request for access, this relates, for example, to the structure in which the information is presented (such as the use of paragraphs).

> A CSV file stores values from a table as lines of text. The values are separated by punctuation marks. When the information from a CSV file is displayed as lines of text and therefore appears unstructured, the form in which the information is presented is not easily accessible. Those involved cannot immediately abstract the information from this. By using a spreadsheet program, the information from a CSV file can be displayed in tabular form. A CSV file can automatically be opened in tabular form in a spreadsheet program, but this is not always the case, depending on the settings, for example. The files Uber provided to complainants contain a comma as a separator between the values. This is not automatically usable as a list separator in all cases, for example in countries or regions where a comma is also used as a decimal separator (such as the Netherlands and France). Uber does not provide any information about how the information from the CSV files can be presented in a structured manner if the file is not automatically opened in tabular form: the person concerned must find this out themselves 7 . Uber has therefore not provided the information in an easily accessible form and has violated Article 12(1) GDPR.

### Language: Uber's view

According to Uber, by testing whether the guidance notes have been provided in an understandable language, the AP is not testing against the correct standard. Pursuant to Article 12(1) of the GDPR, the language must be 'clear and simple'. Uber takes the position that the guidance notes have been provided in clear and simple language. Not a good but a reasonable command of English is sufficient to understand the guidance notes. Uber can also assume that French drivers have a good command of English, because French taxi drivers (and therefore also Uber drivers) are required to have a VTC registration. This requires an exam to be taken in which, among other things, English is tested at A2 level.

### Language: review

Although the research report incorrectly used only the criterion 'understandable', this does not change the outcome of the assessment. Pursuant to Article 12(1) GDPR, information must be provided in clear and simple language. This means, among other things, that when the controller addresses data subjects who speak a different language, a translation into that language must be provided. 8 The requirement to use clear and simple language is closely related to comprehensibility. 9 Uber was not allowed to assume that the French drivers have sufficient knowledge of English to understand the English guidance notes. The fact that French Uber drivers must take an exam for their VTC registration in which, among other things, English at A2 level is tested does not change this, because a poor score on the English part can be compensated with a good score on other exam parts. 10 Successfully completing the exam for a VTC registration therefore does not indicate a command of English 11 . Even if this were the case, the AP is of the opinion that command of English at level A2 is insufficient to understand the English guidance notes. For reading and understanding a text at A2 level, the following standard applies in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) 12 : “I can read very short, simple texts. I can find specific predictable information in simple, everyday texts such as advertisements, leaflets, menus and timetables and I can understand short, simple, personal letters.” The guidance notes are a 26-page document that explains the various very specific table values, such as telematic data and various device data. This goes beyond the level of a very short and simple text as indicated by the CEFR. In this context, the AP also points to the fine that the Swedish Supervisory Authority (IMY) imposed on Spotify, 13 for, among other things, not providing technical log files in the language of those involved (but only in English). The controller must take sufficient measures to ensure that data subjects understand the information. By providing drivers with guidance notes only in English and not in local languages, Uber has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

Since June 29, 2022, Uber has offered the guidance notes in multiple languages, including French.

## 4.4 Privacy statement: retention periods

In its response to a request for access, Uber refers to the privacy statement for the retention periods. The investigation report found that the information provided by Uber in Privacy Statement 14 regarding retention periods is too general, causing Uber to violate Article 13(2)(a) and Article 15(1)(d) of the GDPR.

### Uber's view

Uber indicates that the explanation in Guidelines 15 that it is insufficient to state that personal data will be retained for as long as necessary for the lawful purpose of the processing goes beyond what the GDPR requires. This is at odds with Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, in which the criterion for determining the retention period is formulated in this way and the AP may not base a violation on the Guidelines alone. In addition, information must be presented in a concise and understandable manner pursuant to Article 12(1) GDPR. In the case of Uber as a multinational, there are different retention periods per processing per country, in certain countries per city, per category of data subjects 16 and these periods are subject to change. Mentioning specific retention periods would lead to an extension of the privacy statement by dozens to hundreds of pages. Article 13(2)(a) GDPR also only prescribes that retention periods must be stated if possible, which is not the case with Uber for the aforementioned reason. Uber also states that the AP cannot conclude on the basis of the investigation report that there is a violation of Article 15(1) GDPR, because drivers are provided with information in various ways in response to a request for access and this is not included in the report. In addition, the guidelines against which the AP assesses are not relevant to Article 15 of the GDPR. In assessing the version of the privacy statement of

On October 15, 2020, the AP wrongly did not include passage 17 in the assessment, while according to Uber, that passage meets the requirements that the AP assesses. 

### Judgement

In the version of the privacy statement dated November 12, 2019, Uber states that personal data (of drivers) will be retained as long as the user has an account. In addition, Uber may retain information as necessary for safety, security and fraud prevention purposes, followed by example. In the version of September 1, 2021, the information about the retention periods boils down to the fact that Uber retains personal data for as long as necessary for various purposes, followed by the statement that users (including drivers) can request to delete their account, after which the data will be deleted unless it is required to be retained for a longer period of time for safety, security and fraud prevention purposes or account related matters. Because Uber is bound by laws and regulations regarding (among others) drivers, this generally means a retention period of at least seven years for both the account and the data after a request to delete the account, according to Uber's privacy statement.

Pursuant to Article 13(2)(a) GDPR, the controller must, when obtaining the personal data, inform the data subject of the period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if that is not possible, the criteria for determining that period. term. The AP notes that Uber does not mention any (concrete) retention periods in either version of the privacy statement. In the privacy statement of September 1, 2021, Uber mentions a retention period of seven years, but this period is not formulated in sufficient concrete terms (it only concerns a minimum retention period and applies 'in general', although it is not clear under what circumstances this period may or may not apply). applies) and relates exclusively to those cases in which a request for deletion of an account has been made. Uber has indicated in its view, among other things, that there are many different retention periods. The AP notes that these different retention periods are not mentioned in the privacy statement.

In its opinion, Uber has also indicated that, given the many different retention periods, it is not possible to mention all specific retention periods and that it is therefore sufficient to mention the criteria for determining the periods. According to Uber, mentioning all specific retention periods would lead to a privacy statement that is pages long, which is contrary to Article 12(1) of the GDPR. The AP agrees that, given the circumstances mentioned, **Uber may suffice by stating the criteria for determining the retention periods, but notes that these are also not sufficiently mentioned in the privacy statement**. Simply stating in a general sense that personal data is retained for as long as necessary for certain purposes (as Uber does) cannot be equated with stating criteria for determining the retention period. In the opinion of the AP, the obligation to state criteria for determining the retention period cannot be interpreted other than that data subjects must be able to determine the retention periods for their personal data, and in view of this the information provided by Uber is too general. of nature. The AP determines that Uber has violated Article 13(2)(a) of the GDPR. Contrary to what is stated in the investigation report, the AP sees insufficient grounds in the investigation findings to establish a violation of Article 15, paragraph 1, opening words and (d), GDPR.

## 4.5 Privacy statement: transfer

In its response to a request for access, Uber refers to the privacy statement for information about transfers. The investigation report established that the privacy statement does not mention the countries outside the EEA to which the transfer of personal data takes place and which specific measures have been taken for this, as a result of which Uber is subject to Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f), and Article 15, second paragraph, GDPR has violated.

### Uber's view

Uber argues that Article 13(1)(f) of the GDPR does not require that transfer countries be mentioned. The EDPB's interpretation in the Guidelines 18 that in accordance with the fairness principle the information on transfers should be as meaningful as possible and that this means generally identifying the third country is incorrect. In view of the opening words, the principle of fairness has already been filled in in Article 13, second paragraph, GDPR (as the AP understands the view: filled in exhaustively) and therefore does not apply to the first paragraph of Article 13 GDPR. The EDPB's explanation contradicts the text and system of Article 13, first and second paragraph, GDPR. In addition, the AP cannot base a violation solely on the guidelines. The guidelines also only require that third countries be mentioned in general and it is impossible for Uber to determine prior to any processing to which specific countries the personal data is transferred. Uber would then have to include all 72 countries in which it offers its app in the privacy statement and this will not be meaningful or understandable. The same applies to mentioning all protection measures per country. Uber is also of the opinion that given the shared processing responsibility of Uber BV and Uber Technologies Inc. in this context, there is no transfer of personal data to third countries, because the processing falls within the scope of the GDPR in view of Article 3(1) GDPR.

Article 15(2) GDPR also does not require that transfer countries be mentioned and the explanation in the Guidelines does not apply to Article 15. Uber also states that the AP cannot conclude on the basis of the investigation report that there has been a violation of Article 15(2) of the GDPR, because drivers are provided with information in various ways in response to a request for access and this is not included in the report. The versions of the privacy statement assessed by the AP amply meet the requirements set by Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f) of the GDPR, partly because in all versions it was possible to click on 'Standard contractual clauses', after which a web page the European Commission's standard provisions could be downloaded.

Finally, Uber states that the AP wrongly did not include the privacy statement of June 13, 2022 in its assessment.

### Judgement

Article 13(1)(f) GDPR primarily requires the controller to inform data subjects, where appropriate, that the controller intends to transfer the personal data to a third country. The AP notes that in the various versions of the privacy statement 19, Uber only states that Uber transfers personal data to a third country or third countries. With regard to the applicable safeguards, **Article 13(1)(f) GDPR requires an indication as to whether or not an adequacy decision by the Commission exists, or which other appropriate safeguards apply** and how to obtain a copy of this are obtained or where they can be consulted. The information requirements set out in this provision are so specific that data subjects must be given access to detailed information about the safeguards used to protect their personal data during transfer. In the guidelines, the EDPB expresses this as saying that, in accordance with the principle of fairness, the information must be as meaningful as possible. 20 If a data subject wants to know to which countries his personal data is transferred, the foregoing means that the relevant transfer countries are mentioned. In the various versions of the privacy statement, **Uber only mentions the various applicable guarantees in general terms and without providing definitive answers (for example in the privacy statement of September 1, 2021: “ We do so in order to fulfill our agreements with users, such as our Terms of Use, or based on users' prior consent, adequacy decisions for the relevant countries, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses ”) and does not indicate how a copy of can be obtained or where they can be consulted. This does not give data subjects the opportunity to determine which guarantees may be relevant to them and what exactly these guarantees entail** (by being able to consult the applicable guarantees). Uber has therefore violated Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f) of the GDPR. Contrary to what Uber argues in its view, the fact that the principle of propriety is further elaborated in the second paragraph of Article 13 GDPR excludes the applicability of the principle of propriety from Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to the first paragraph of Article 13 GDPR does not apply. 21

With regard to Uber's response to a request for access, the AP sees, contrary to what is stated in the investigation report, insufficient grounds in the investigation findings to establish a violation of Article 15, paragraph 2, GDPR.

## 4.6 Privacy statement: data portability

The investigation report found that Uber does not explicitly mention the right to data portability in the privacy statement and therefore does not comply with Article 13, paragraph 2, opening words and (b), GDPR.

### Uber's view

According to Uber, Article 20(1) GDPR shows that the right to data portability consists of two actions, namely obtaining (from Uber) and transferring (by the data subject). Uber indicates that the right to data portability is mentioned in the privacy statement, namely as 'receiving data'. Uber also explains in its privacy statement what the right to data portability entails, deliberately without using complex terms (such as data portability). Guidelines 22 (which state that a distinction must be made between the right to data portability and other rights) only provide an explanation and the AP cannot base a violation on this alone. Finally, Uber states that the AP wrongly did not include the privacy statement of September 1, 2021 in its assessment.

### Judgement

Article 13, paragraph 2, opening words and (b) of the GDPR obliges the controller to inform the data subject, among other things, about the right to data portability when providing personal data. The AP notes that **Uber does not explicitly mention the right to data portability in the various versions of the privacy statement** 23 . The AP does not follow Uber's position that 'receiving data' provides information about the right to data portability, because receiving the personal data processed by Uber can also give effect to the right of access under Article 15 GDPR. are understood. The obligation under Article 13, paragraph 2, opening words and (b), GDPR to inform about the right to data portability naturally means that this right must be mentioned separately and explicitly. This is also explained as such in the guidelines. 24 By not separately and explicitly stating the right to data portability, Uber violated Article 13(2)(b) of the GDPR.

As of November 3, 2022, Uber explicitly mentions the right to data portability in its privacy statement. The violation has thus ended.

# 5. 	Administrative fine

## 5.1 	Uber's view

In its opinion - in summary - Uber has put forward that the investigation report does not justify any recovery or sanction measures. Uber refers to its view already given per violation (from the investigation report). In addition, Uber is of the opinion that the lex certa principle precludes enforcement, because the provisions against which the AP assesses Uber's actions in the investigation report are often not clear and crystallized and are therefore unforeseeable. The imposition of

According to Uber, a measure also leads to disproportionate consequences for Uber within the meaning of Article 3:4, second paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act (AWB), because Uber is constantly improving its services and has always shown itself willing to to cooperate with the AP. Finally, Uber takes the position that it was wrongly not given the opportunity to express a view on the content of a proposed sanction decision. The intention to enforce that Uber has received from the AP is too general and does not give Uber the opportunity to express its views on the amount of the fine, the severity and extent of the violations observed and the ultimate substantiation thereof.

### 5.1.1 	Assessment of administrative fine

The AP concluded that Uber violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR by not providing the information in the CSV files in an easily accessible form and by only providing the guidance notes in English. This took place in the period from May 25, 2018 to June 29, 2022. Secondly, Uber violated Article 12, paragraph 2, GDPR because the digital form with which drivers can exercise their right of access and data portability is not easily accessible in the drivers' offices. -app. This violation took place in the period from May 25, 2018 to February 17, 2022.

Thirdly, the information provided by Uber about retention periods in the privacy statement is too general in nature, as a result of which Uber has violated Article 13(2)(a) of the GDPR. Fourth, Uber has violated Article 13(1)(f) of the GDPR because the information provided about transfers in the privacy statement is incomplete. The AP determines this for the period from May 25, 2018 to the date of the investigation report (June 30, 2022).

Finally, Uber has not explicitly mentioned the right to data portability in its privacy statement, which leads to a violation of Article 13, paragraph 2, opening words and (b), GDPR. This took place from May 25, 2018 to November 3, 2022.

The AP sees reason to use its authority under Article 58, second paragraph, opening words and under i, in conjunction with Article 83 GDPR and Article 14, third paragraph, GDPR Implementation Act, to Uber (Uber Technologies Inc. and Uber BV jointly) to impose an administrative fine.

### 5.1.2 	Invocation of the lex certa principle

With regard to Uber's appeal to the lex certa principle, which is included in Article 49 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, the AP considers the following. As the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State has considered on several occasions, 25 the lex certa principle requires the legislator to describe the prohibited conduct as clearly as possible, with a view to legal certainty. It should not be forgotten that the legislator sometimes describes prohibited conduct with a certain vagueness, consisting of the use of general terms, in order to prevent conduct that is punishable from falling outside the scope of that description. This vagueness may be unavoidable, because it is not always possible to predict how the interests to be protected will be violated in the future and because, if this is foreseeable, the descriptions of prohibited conduct would otherwise become too refined, resulting in a lack of clarity. disappears and thus the importance of the general clarity of legislation is damaged. In other words, the lex certa principle requires the legislator to describe the prohibited conduct as clearly as possible, with a view to legal certainty. 26

Uber's argument about the lex certa principle focuses on the violation found by the AP with regard to the accessibility of the form for access requests and the form of information provision in relation to the CSV files. The AP is of the opinion that an “easily accessible format” within the meaning of Article 12(1) GDPR means that information provided in response to a request for access must be able to be represented in a structured manner in a CSV file (when the file does not automatically open this way), without the person concerned having to figure out how to do this. There is no conflict with the lex certa principle because the text of the provision is sufficiently clear. This is especially true now that Guidelines 27 indicate that the element “easily accessible” means that the data subject does not have to search for that information himself; it must be immediately clear to the data subject where and how to find this information. The fact that the concept of “easily accessible” from Article 12(1) GDPR requires an explanation based on the specific circumstances does not mean that an administrative fine imposed for violation of this provision is contrary to the lex certa principle. . In the AP's opinion, the violation relating to the accessibility of the form for inspection requests is also not in conflict with the lex certa principle. In view of the text of Article 12(2) of the GDPR, the controller must facilitate the exercise of a data subject's right to access his or her personal data. In the opinion of the AP, this standard is sufficiently clear in the sense that measures by a controller that create barriers to the exercise of that right are in conflict with it. Due to the combination of the number of steps to be taken and their wording, Uber creates such a high barrier for those involved that Uber does not sufficiently facilitate its drivers.

### 5.1.3 	Opportunity to express views

With regard to Uber's position that it was wrongly not given the opportunity to submit an opinion on the amount of the fine, the seriousness and extent of the violations observed and the ultimate substantiation, the AP considers the following. Neither Article 4:8 nor Article 5:50 of the General Administrative Law Act (read in conjunction with Articles 5:48 and 5:53 of the General Administrative Law Act) nor any other provision obliges the AP to comment on this matter when it intends to impose an administrative fine. aspects. 28 Uber was therefore not wrongly not given the opportunity to express its views on this. What is stated in the opinion may contribute to the AP's decision to proceed imposing an administrative fine, after which the AP determines the amount of the fine on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances known to it at that time. For this reason, the AP has not commented on the aspects mentioned by Uber in its intention.

## 5.2 Systematic determination of the fine amount

At the plenary meeting of 24 May 2023, the EDPB agreed to adopt the Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (hereinafter: the Guidelines). 29 The Guidelines are directly applicable because they do not provide for transitional law for proceedings that were already underway at the time of adoption of the Guidelines. The AP will therefore apply these Guidelines to this case. 30

The Guidelines describe a methodology in which the following is considered:

which and how many acts and infringements are subject to assessment;

which starting amount is the starting point for calculating the fine for this;

whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances arise that require an adjustment of the amount from step 2;
what maximum amounts apply to the violations and whether any increases from the previous step do not exceed this amount;
whether the final amount of the calculated fine meets the requirements of effectiveness, deterrence and proportionality, and is adjusted accordingly if necessary.

These steps are followed successively below.

## 5.3 Calculation of starting amount

### 5.3.1 	Step 1: Determine actions and determine infringements

To determine the starting amount of the fine, it must first be determined, as described in the Guidelines, whether there is one or more sanctionable conduct.

The AP first noted that Uber, in response to a request for access from a data subject, did not provide information on how the CSV file can be opened (how the information from the provided CSV file can be displayed in a structured manner). The AP also found that Uber did not provide information about the data in the CSV file (the guidance notes ) in the language of those involved, but only in English. As concluded above, are both points are contrary to Uber's obligation to inform the data subject in an intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language, as laid down in Article 12(1) of the GDPR. In addition, the AP has also established a violation of the second paragraph of Article 12, namely because the digital form with which drivers can exercise their right to access and data portability is not easily accessible in the driver app.

The AP further found that Uber's privacy statement was deficient on three points: i) the information provided by Uber about retention periods was too general in nature to enable data subjects to determine the retention periods for their personal data; (ii) the information did not mention the different safeguards applicable to international transfers of personal data; and iii) the right to data portability was not mentioned separately and expressly. These points are contrary to Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f), and second paragraph, opening words and (a) and (b), of the GDPR.

In the opinion of the AP, this case concerns two distinct sanctionable behaviors ("plurality of action"). The AP firstly takes into account that the behavior takes place at a different point in time. The use of an inadequate privacy statement takes place continuously after its publication, while the information in response to an information request is only provided after a driver has made a request for access. Secondly, the conduct is not necessarily aimed at the same group of stakeholders. After all, not every driver who consults the privacy statement also makes a request for access and vice versa. Thirdly (and finally), the AP takes into account that the violations can exist independently of each other and are not causally related to each other. The fact that they are now being dealt with together in one decision is because they came to the attention of the AP at the same time.

Now that Uber has committed conduct that can be distinguished from each other, both conduct can be fined separately. The amounts in the following steps must therefore be determined for both infringements.

### 5.3.2 	Step 2: Determine starting amount

As described in the Guidelines, the starting amount of the fine must then be determined. This starting amount forms the basis for further calculation in later steps, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The Guidelines state that the starting amount is determined on the basis of three elements: i) the categorization of the infringements according to Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR; ii) the seriousness of the infringement and iii) the turnover of the company. All three elements are discussed below.

Ad i) Categorization of the infringements according to Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR

As stated in the Guidelines, virtually all obligations of the controller are categorized under the provisions of Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR. The GDPR makes distinction between two types of infringements. On the one hand, the infringements that are sanctionable on the basis of Article 83, paragraph 4, of the GDPR and for which a maximum fine of € 10 million (or in the case of a company, 2% of the annual turnover, whichever is higher), and on the other hand, the infringements that are sanctionable under Article 83, fifth and sixth paragraphs, of the GDPR and for which a maximum fine of
20 million (or in the case of a company, 4% of annual turnover, whichever is higher). With this distinction, the legislator has provided a first indication in the abstract of the seriousness of the infringement: the more serious the infringement, the higher the fine.

For the current violations of Article 12, first and second paragraph, Article 13, second paragraph, opening words and under a, Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and under f, and Article 13, second paragraph, opening words and under b, GDPR, you can an administrative fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000.00 (or in the case of a company, 4% of the worldwide annual turnover, if higher). It follows from this categorization that violations of these provisions are regarded as serious by the legislator.

Ad ii) Seriousness of the infringements

To determine the seriousness of the infringement, Guidelines 31 require that the nature, severity and duration of the infringement be taken into account, as well as the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement and the categories of personal data involved.

With regard to the nature of the violations, the AP notes that the controller must provide the data subject with the information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing towards the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and the context in which the personal data are processed. incorporated. 32 The right of access, as well as the right to receive understandable and easily accessible information about the processing of personal data, is necessary to enable data subjects to exercise their other rights under the GDPR. Providing transparent information within the meaning of Article 12(1) GDPR is very important for that reason. If the rights of data subjects are not respected, this affects the right that data subjects have to respect for their privacy and the protection of their personal data. The right of access and the right to receive understandable and easily accessible information about the processing of personal data may also be important for data subjects when asserting or exercising rights other than those under the GDPR, for example in civil proceedings. That is why it is also important that data subjects can exercise the aforementioned rights under the GDPR and that no unreasonable barriers are imposed in this regard.

When assessing the seriousness of the violations, the number of (possible) people involved is first taken into account. The AP is aware that approximately 120,000 Uber drivers were active in Europe during the period of the violations.

Secondly, in assessing the severity of the violation, the AP takes into account that although Uber has committed the above-mentioned violations of the GDPR, it is not the case that Uber has in no way complied with its obligations under Article 12. , first and second paragraph, Article 13, second paragraph, opening words and (a), Article 13, first paragraph, opening words and (f), and Article 13, second paragraph, opening words and (b), GDPR. For example, although Uber has not fully informed data subjects in its privacy statement about the retention periods, Uber has provided some information about this. The same applies to the information about transfers in the privacy statement: although the AP has found a violation in this regard, it cannot be said that Uber has completely failed to provide information about transfers. With regard to Uber's response to a request for access, it has not been established that the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR have not been met at all, but the violation is limited to the language of the guidance notes and the accessibility of the CSV -files. In addition , with regard to both the language of the guidance notes and the accessibility of the CSV files, this violation will not actually have consequences for every driver who has requested access. After all, the English language of the guidance notes will not lead to less or no understanding of the content for every driver, and there are also some Member States where English is the official language. In addition, there will also be drivers whose CSV files automatically open in table form. Furthermore, the AP has not found that the violations resulted in (substantial) damage to those involved. Furthermore, with regard to the violation of Article 12(2) of the GDPR, it is not the case that Uber has made it completely impossible for data subjects to exercise their right of access and data portability. In the opinion of the AP, there was negligence in committing the violations. 33 The AP considers that element as “neutral”. With regard to the categories of personal data involved, the AP notes that it has been established that location data is being processed, which are personal data of a sensitive nature. Furthermore, the AP considers that it may be challenging for Uber to provide comprehensive information about the rights of data subjects in a manner that is understandable to data subjects, which entails compromises in assessing how the information can best be presented . The research and the information provided by Uber during the opinion phase also show that Uber has taken many measures to improve and continue to improve the procedures for those involved.

The duration of the violations has been established above for a significant period, namely the period from May 25, 2018 to February 17, 2022, June 29, 2022 and November 3, 2022.

Ad iii) Turnover of the company

The Guidelines prescribe that, from the point of view of fairness, the starting amount of the fine must be related to the size of the company. The size of the company is determined on the basis of turnover. For example, for a small company with a turnover of up to € 2 million, the starting amount is generally limited to 0.2 to 0.4% of the actual starting amount, and the starting amount increases as the company's turnover increases. If a company has a turnover of more than €500 million, the fine is determined as a percentage of the annual turnover of the company.

As a result, the size and turnover of the company has already been taken into account in the amount of the fine, so that the starting amount does not need to be adjusted on that basis.

As mentioned in Recital 150 of the GDPR, when imposing a fine on an undertaking, the “undertaking” should be regarded as an undertaking under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It follows from established case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union that an undertaking is “any entity that carries out an economic activity, regardless of its legal form and the way in which it is financed.” It is therefore about the economic unit of the company and not about the legal entities within it. Several companies or entities within the same economic unit can therefore jointly constitute an undertaking within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions.

Uber BV is indirectly a fully owned subsidiary of Uber Technologies Inc. They must therefore be regarded as part of the same company for the purposes of Article 83 of the GDPR.

As stated in the Guidelines, turnover can be determined on the basis of the company's annual accounts for the previous financial year. Pursuant to Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR, the worldwide turnover in the previous financial year is taken into account. Since this decision was taken in 2023, the 2022 financial year will be retained.

Uber Technologies Inc. has published the 2022 annual accounts on its website. 35 A consolidated overview of the company is included on page 74. This shows that the company's global turnover for 2022 will be $31.877 billion. This corresponds to €29.750 billion. 36

Determine starting amount

Pursuant to Article 83(5) of the GDPR, the maximum fine is 4% of the annual turnover. The annual turnover, as stated, is € 29.750 billion, so that the maximum fine for each of the violations is € 1.19 billion.

In view of what was considered under i) and ii), the AP takes the position that the level of seriousness of the infringements should be qualified as “low”. According to the Guidelines, for infringements with a low level of severity, the starting amount should be set at a point between 0 and 10% of the maximum fine. The general rule is that the more serious the infringement within its own category, the higher the starting amount will be.

The AP is of the opinion that, given the circumstances described, the infringements in question are in themselves of minor seriousness. The starting point for calculating the fine must therefore be relatively low


From an annual turnover of €500 million, 4% of the annual turnover is higher than €20 million, so that this percentage must be taken into account as a maximum fine (Article 83, fifth paragraph, opening words, of the GDPR).

The exchange rate determined by the ECB on the day of this decision is € 0.9333 per US dollar (cf < https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/eurofxref-graph-usd.en.html >). compared to the starting amount. Taking all the foregoing into account, the AP sets the starting amount in this case at €5 million for each of the violations (€10 million in total). This corresponds to 0.42% of the applicable maximum fine.


## 5.4 Assessment of mitigating or aggravating circumstances

### 5.4.1 	Step 3: Assess relevant circumstances

As stated in the Guidelines, it must then be considered whether the circumstances of the case give reason to set the fine higher or lower than the starting amount determined above. The circumstances to be taken into account are stated in Article 83(2)(a) to (k) of the GDPR. The circumstances mentioned in that provision must each be considered only once. In the previous step, the nature, severity and duration of the violation (part a), the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (part b) and the categories of personal data (part g) have already been taken into account. This leaves parts c to f and h to k.

The only applicable circumstance is the manner in which the AP became aware of the infringement, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller notified the infringement (section h). In this case, Uber did not report the violations itself, but they came to the attention of the AP through complaints. However, according to the Guidelines, this is assessed as “neutral” and therefore has no consequences for the amount of the fine to be imposed.

The other circumstances do not apply in this case because the circumstances to which they refer do not occur in this case.


## 5.5 Determining the amount of the fine

Section 5.3.2 sets a starting amount of €5 million for each of the violations. In paragraph 5.4.1 it was concluded that the only circumstance that can be further taken into account should be assessed as neutral. The conclusion is therefore that the fine should be set at €5 million for each of the two violations (€10 million in total).

### 5.5.1 	Step 4: Check whether the maximum amounts applicable for the infringements are exceeded

As mentioned, - also taking into account Uber's turnover - a maximum fine of 4% of the company's worldwide annual turnover applies to the violations found. Given Uber's turnover (€ 29.750 billion), the legal maximum fine to be imposed is therefore € 1.19 billion per violation.

Above, the fine amount for the identified violations has been set at €5 million per violation. This is well below the legal maximum, so that it will not be exceeded.

### 5.5.2 	Step 5: Assessment of effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence requirements

Finally, the AP assesses whether the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. On the basis of Article 49, third paragraph, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and Articles 3:4 and 5:46, second paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act, the administrative fine may not, given the circumstances of the specific case, lead to a disproportionate outcome.

Pursuant to Article 83, paragraph 5, opening words and (b), GDPR, the AP can impose an administrative fine for the violations described above. As described in the Guidelines, the imposition of a fine can be considered effective if it achieves the purpose for which it was imposed. That purpose may be to punish unlawful conduct on the one hand and to promote compliance with the applicable regulations on the other. Considering the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, as well as the other factors from Article 83, paragraph 2, GDPR as assessed in paragraphs 5.3.2 and 5.4 of this decision, the AP is of the opinion that the imposition of an administrative fine under these circumstances achieves both objectives and is therefore effective and deterrent. The AP also considers the amount of the administrative fine, which is partly determined on the basis of Uber's turnover, to be effective and deterrent.

The AP considers the fine proportionate given the seriousness of the violation and the size of the company. Uber has indicated in its opinion that imposing a measure will have disproportionate consequences for Uber, because Uber is constantly working to improve its services and has always shown itself willing to cooperate with the AP. The AP sees no reason to consider the fine disproportionate. After all, both complying with the provisions of the GDPR and providing cooperation to the AP in exercising its powers are legally required. In the opinion of the AP, no special circumstances have arisen in this context that the fine would not be proportionate for the reasons stated by Uber.
