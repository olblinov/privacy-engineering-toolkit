- **Uber fined €10 million for (1) data access; (2) retention; and (3) TIA controls transparency violation** (https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/current/uber-fined-eu10-million-for-infringement-of-privacy-regulations, https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/uploads/2024-01/Boetebesluit%20Uber%20.pdf, [unofficial English translation](uber_case.md)):
  - Uber has an app for drivers. The French association of drivers raised a concern with CNIL about principle of transparency & right to data access in the app
  - Issues:
    - *Easy of finding the interface for getting a copy of your data*
      - DPA argued that (1) the user has to be able to find the interface "intuitively"; and (2) 6 steps for downloading data is too much
      - The following was the winning formula: "The steps via the Privacy Center are as follows: Account security and privacy> privacy center > Would you like a copy of your personal data? > log in or “Submit a privacy inquiry without an account” after which the driver will arrive at the form".
    - *CSV format*: DPA argues that CSV is a good format but the company needs to provide instructions on how to open it as the strings are not structured when opened in text editor and tabulation may not happen automatically if settings are wrong.
    - *Language*: Exports should be provided in French to French users. Quite similar to Spotify case last year.
    - *Specificity of retention periods*: Uber may suffice by stating the criteria for determining the retention periods, but notes that these are also not sufficiently mentioned in the privacy statement.
    - *International transfers disclosures*: Uber only mentions the various applicable guarantees in general terms and without providing definitive answers. This does not give data subjects the opportunity to determine which guarantees may be relevant to them and what exactly these guarantees entail (by being able to consult the applicable guarantees). However, Article 13(1)(f) GDPR requires an indication as to whether or not an adequacy decision by the Commission exists, or which other appropriate safeguards apply and how to obtain a copy of this are obtained or where they can be consulted. The information requirements set out in this provision are so specific that data subjects must be given access to detailed information about the safeguards used to protect their personal data during transfer. 
    - *Data portability*: Needs to be mentioned specifically in the Privacy Notice. 

- **FTC claims changing terms quietly could be unfair or deceptive** (https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/02/ai-other-companies-quietly-changing-your-terms-service-could-be-unfair-or-deceptive): It may be unfair or deceptive for a company to adopt more permissive data practices—for example, to start sharing consumers’ data with third parties or using that data for AI training—and to only inform consumers of this change through a surreptitious, retroactive amendment to its terms of service or privacy policy. A business that collects user data based on one set of privacy commitments cannot then unilaterally renege on those commitments after collecting users’ data. Especially given that certain features of digital markets can make it more difficult for users to easily switch between services, users may lack recourse once a firm has used attractive privacy commitments to lure them to the product only to turn around and then back out of those commitments.

- **DoorDash fined $375k for selling data to a marketing co-op** (https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-settlement-doordash-investigation-finds-company, https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/DoorDash%20Complaint.pdf): DoorDash sold its California customers’ personal information without providing notice or an opportunity to opt out of that sale in violation of both the CCPA and CalOPPA. The sale occurred in connection with DoorDash’s participation in a marketing cooperative, where businesses contribute the personal information of their customers in exchange for the opportunity to advertise their products to each other’s customers. Interestingly, the violation was identified due to one user who had received mailed advertisements at her home that were addressed to an alias that she had used solely with DoorDash when ordering its food delivery services.

- **Avast banned from selling browsing data collected via extensions + USD 16.5M fine** (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-order-will-ban-avast-selling-browsing-data-advertising-purposes-require-it-pay-165-million-over, https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Complaint-Avast.pdf): The Federal Trade Commission will require software provider Avast to pay $16.5 million and prohibit the company from selling or licensing any web browsing data for advertising purposes to settle charges that the company and its subsidiaries sold such information to third parties after promising that its products would protect consumers from online tracking. The company claimed it used a special algorithm to remove identifying information before transferring the data to its clients. The FTC, however, says the company failed to sufficiently anonymize consumers’ browsing information that it sold in non-aggregate form through various products. For example, its data feeds included a unique identifier for each web browser it collected information from and could include every website visited, precise timestamps, type of device and browser, and the city, state, and country. When Avast did describe its data sharing practices, Avast falsely claimed it would only transfer consumers’ personal information in aggregate and anonymous form, according to the complaint. Some of the Jumpshot products were designed to allow clients to track specific users or even to associate specific users—and their browsing histories—with other information those clients had. For example, as alleged in the complaint, Jumpshot entered into a contract with Omnicom, an advertising conglomerate, which stated that Jumpshot would provide Omnicom with an “All Clicks Feed” for 50% of its customers in the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, Canada, and Germany.

- **EDPB announces launch of coordinated enforcement on the right of access** (https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/cef-2024-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-access_en): Throughout the year, 31 Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), including 7 German State-level DPAs, across the EEA will take part in this initiative on the implementation of the right of access. Participating DPAs will implement the CEF in a number of ways: (1) organisations will be sent questionnaires to aid fact-finding exercises or to identify if a formal investigation is warranted; (2) commencement of a formal investigation; and/or
(3) follow-up of ongoing formal investigations.

- **Record EUR 6.1M fine for leaking data of a thousand people in Spain** (https://www.aepd.es/documento/ps-00002-2023.pdf): The Spanish DPA fined Endesa Energía, S.A.U €6.1 million for lack of sufficient security measures resulting in vulnerability of data relating to around a thousand customers. The decisions stands out as by previous calculations the fine is typically around EUR 3 per person, in stark contrast to EUR 6.1k per person in this case.

- **NIST publishes NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf): NIST’s cybersecurity framework (CSF) now explicitly aims to help all organizations — not just those in critical infrastructure, its original target audience — to manage and reduce risks. NIST has updated the CSF’s core guidance and created a suite of resources to help all organizations achieve their cybersecurity goals, with added emphasis on governance as well as supply chains.

- **EDPB clarifies meaning of 'main establishment' for purposes of One-Stop-Shop mechanism** (https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/edpb-clarifies-notion-main-establishment-and-calls-eu-legislators-make-sure-csam_en, https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-02/edpb_opinion_202404_mainestablishment_en.pdf): The EDPB considers that a controller’s “place of central administration” in the EU can be considered as a main establishment under Art. 4(16)(a) GDPR only if it takes the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data and if it has the power to have such decisions implemented. The EDPB further explains that the One-Stop-Shop mechanism can only apply if there is evidence that one of the establishments of the controller in the Union takes decisions on the purposes and means for the relevant processing operations and has the power to have these decisions implemented. This means that, when the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing are taken outside of the EU, there should be no main establishment of the controller in the Union, and therefore the One-Stop-Shop should not apply.

- **Capio A/S fined EUR 200k for lack of 3rd party management system (i.e. lack of accountability)** (https://www.datatilsynet.dk/afgoerelser/afgoerelser/2024/feb/privathospitalet-capio-as-indstilles-til-boede): The DPA found that 3 data processors were not supervised by the controller despite processing sensitive data. It is thus the opinion of the Data Protection Authority that the private hospital has not been able to secure and demonstrate that personal data is processed for legal and reasonable purposes and in a way, which ensures adequate security for the personal data concerned. Against this background, the Danish Data Protection Agency has decided to report to Capio A / S for not acting in accordance with the data protection principle of accountability.

- **100k fine for inaccurate retention period disclosure** (https://www.cnil.fr/en/data-retention-period-and-data-security-cnil-fined-pap-100000-euros): The company had set a five-year retention period for data relating to users of the site's free services, but failed to apply it, since it retained data for longer periods. Also, additional violations re transparency and Art. 28 were committed.

- **Lack of (any) meaningful GDPR compliance nets EUR 200k fine in Italy** (https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9983384#2): The inspection carried out by the Guarantor also revealed that the owner of the site did not have a specific privacy policy inherent in the retention times of the data processed. It had not drawn up the register of processing activities, it had not appointed the data protection officer (DPR), nor had it prepared the impact assessment (DPIA). The controller also did not collect consent for processing of sensitive data (sexual orientation and sex life) from its 1,012,421 users. The calculation is therefore approx EUR 0.2 / person.  

- **NIST Publishes A Cybersecurity Resource Guide for HIPAA Security Rule** (https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/66/r2/final, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-66r2.pdf): Massive 122-page document with everything you need for information security, even if you are not a HIPAA-covered entity. 

- **Reviewing 5,000 pages to fulfil a data access request ruled not to be disproportionate by Berlin Federal Administrative Court** (https://gesetze.berlin.de/perma?d=JURE240003073): The court stated that controllers may use the exception o disproportionate effort in very limited exceptional cases. And that having to review 5,000 pages of documents apparently did not meet that threshold.
