# **Legal framework**

## ***Union law***

3rd        Art. 8 („ Processing of special categories of personal data “) of Directive 95/46 provides:

„1. Member States shall prohibit the processing of personal data showing racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or union membership, as well as data on health or sex life.

(2) Paragraph 1 does not apply in the following cases:

Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons in connection with the processing of personal data in the Member States, especially in the right to protection of this data, can hinder the free movement of such data across the Union. These differences in the level of protection can therefore be an obstacle to the Union-wide pursuit of economic activities,distort competition and prevent the authorities from fulfilling their obligations under Union law. They can be explained by the differences in the implementation and application of the directive [95/46].

*Law on the circulation of medicinal products*

24      The law on the circulation of medicinal products of 24 August 1976 (BGBl. 1976 I p. 2445) in the version of the announcement of 12 December 2005 (BGBl. 2005 I p. 3394) regulates the circulation of medicinal products in the version relevant to the main proceedings and differentiates between medicinal products that may be dispensed in pharmacies and those that may only be given on a medical prescription and § 48 („ Obligation to prescribe “) are subject.

# **The main proceedings and questions referred**

> 25      ND, which operates a pharmacy under the business name „Lindenapotheke “, has been selling pharmacopoeias that require pharmacies since 2017 via the online platform „Amazon Marketplace “ (hereinafter: Amazon). When ordering these medicines online, ND customers must enter information such as their name, delivery address and the information necessary for the individualization of the medicines.
>

> 26      DR, who also runs a pharmacy, brought an action before the Dessau-Roßlau district court (Germany), requesting that **ND be banned from selling pharmacy-only medicines via Amazon under the threat of regulatory means, as long as it is not ensured that customers have the opportunity in advance to consent to the processing of health data.**
>

27      DR bases its lawsuit on the fact that the distribution of pharmac-related medicinal products via Amazon is unfair due to a violation of legal requirements regarding the obtaining of customer consent required by the legislation on the protection of personal data.

28      With judgment of 28 In March 2018, the Dessau-Roßlau district court upheld the lawsuit.

29      ND appealed this judgment to the Naumburg Higher Regional Court (Germany), which November 2019 was rejected.

30      The Court of Appeal considered the distribution of pharmacopoeia medicinal products via Amazon as an unfair act and therefore in accordance with § 3 para. 1 UWG as inadmissible. Such a distribution of medicinal products leads to the processing of health data, which according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO is prohibited if no express consent of the customers acquiring the medicinal products according to Art. 9 para. 2 letter a DSGVO. The rules of this regulation are to be regarded as market behavior regulations within the meaning of § 3a UWG. DR is a competitor according to § 8 para. 3 no. 1 UWG entitles the civil courts to enforce the right to injunctive relief against ND for violating these rules.

31      ND has appealed to the Federal Court of Justice (Germany), the referring court.

32      According to this court, the decision of the dispute depends on the interpretation of the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO, Art. 9 para. 1 DGSVO and Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46.

> 33      First of all, the referring court raises the question of whether the Member States have since the repeal of Directive 95/46 with effect from 25 May 2018 – the day from which the DSGVO applied – in **national law can continue to provide that competitors of a company like the one in § 8 para. 3 no. 1 UWG are authorized to prevent violations of the provisions of the DSGVO** committed by this company on the basis of the ban on unfair business practices by bringing an action before a civil court.
>

34      The referring court states that this question is answered differently at national level. The answer cannot be clearly derived from the wording of the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO, from the systematic context of these provisions or from the aim pursued by this regulation.

35      Thus, as far as the wording of the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO is concerned, competitors of a company are nowhere explicitly given the opportunity to bring an action against this company, especially in cases where the violation of data protection regulations constitutes unfair business practices. At the same time, a possibility of bringing an action is not expressly excluded.

36      Then, as far as the systematic connection of the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO is concerned, on the one hand with this regulation – as by the Court in the judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland (C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, paragraph 57), – found a fundamentally complete harmonization of national legislation on the protection of personal data. That in Art. 77 para. 1, Art. 78 paragraphs 1 and 2 and Art. 79 para. 1 DSGVO each contains the phrase „without prejudice to any other legal remedy “, on the other hand, one could speak against a final regulation of law enforcement.

37      Finally, as far as the DSGVO's aim of harmonizing data protection law and in particular standardizing the level of enforcement within the Union is concerned, it could, on the one hand, conflict with this goal if competitors had the power to bring an action under competition law and thus had opportunities to enforce data protection provisions that exceeded the instruments provided for in the DSGVO went beyond. It is also not beyond doubt that there is a loophole in the DSGVO enforcement system, which would have to be closed by the approval of the competition law standing of the competitors. There could be a riskthat competition in the enforcement of data protection law between the supervisory authorities on the one hand and the civil courts on the other hand leads to an impairment of the powers of the supervisory authorities and to differences in the enforcement of data protection law within the Union.

38      Giving competitors a right to bring legal action under competition law could, on the other hand, represent an additional possibility of law enforcement that is desirable according to the principle of effectiveness („ effet utile “) in order to ensure the highest possible level of data protection according to the tenth recital in the DSGVO.

39      The referring court points out that this question has not already been resolved by the case-law of the Court of Justice and that the latter in particular in the judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland (C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322), expressly left open the question of a competitor's standing to bring an action.

40      Secondly, the referring court asks whether the data that customers have to enter when ordering medicinal products on the online sales platform (name, address and information necessary for the individualization of medicinal products), „health data “ in the sense of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 represent DSGVO.

41      The answer to this question is not obvious if the medicinal products ordered are non-prescription medicinal products. In such a case, it cannot be ruled out that these medicinal products are not intended for the customers themselves, but for unidentifiable third parties.

42      Based solely on the wording of these provisions and Art. 4 no. 15 DSGVO in connection with their 35th The question cannot be answered in the recital.

43      However, in paragraph 125 of the judgment of 1 August 2022, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija (C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601), decided that the term „special categories of personal data “ according to Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO should be interpreted broadly in view of the aim of this regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons –, in particular their private life –, when processing personal data concerning them. With such a broad interpretation of this term, it could be concluded that such information represented health data even if it was not certain, but only with a certain probability that customers,who ordered the medicines, ordered them for themselves.

44      The referring court explains that the injunction asserted by DR presupposes that the behavior of ND in question was illegal both at the time it was carried out and was illegal at the time of the revision hearing, although at the first of these two times Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 was relevant, but at the second time Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO applies.

45      Against this background, the Federal Court of Justice has decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:

1.  Do the regulations in Chapter VIII DSGVO conflict with national regulations that –, in addition to the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the regulation and the legal protection options of the data subjects –, **give competitors the authority to violate the DSGVO against the Injury to take action before the civil courts** with a view to prohibiting unfair business practices?
2nd      Are the data that **customers of a pharmacist who acts as a seller on an Internet sales platform enter when ordering pharmacists that do not require pharmacies but do not require a prescription on the sales platform (name of the customer, delivery address and necessary for the individualization of the drug that is subject to pharmacy) Information), health data in the sense of Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO** as well as data on health in the sense of Art. 8 Para. 1 of the Data Protection Directive?

# **To the questions referred**

## ***The first question***

46      With its first question, the referring court would like to know whether the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO should be interpreted as precluding national regulation, – in addition to the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing this regulation and the legal protection options of the data subjects – gives competitors of the alleged infringer of regulations for the protection of personal data the power for violations of the DSGVO against the infringer by means of a lawsuit before the civil courts from the point of view of the ban on the conduct of unfair business practices.

47      It should be noted in advance that Chapter VIII DSGVO u. a. regulates the legal remedies with which the rights of the data subject can be protected if the personal data concerning them have been the subject of processing which is allegedly contrary to the provisions of this Ordinance. The protection of these rights can therefore either be carried out directly by the data subject or in accordance with Art. 77 to 79 DSGVO. 80 DSGVO can be claimed by an authorized institution – with or without a corresponding order –(cf. in this sense judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 53).

48      On the one hand, Art sees. 77 para. 1 DSGVO states that, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. By type. 78 para. 1 DSGVO, any natural or legal person has the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority that affects them, without prejudice to any other administrative or extrajudicial legal remedy. Art. 79 para. 1 DSGVO guarantees every data subject the right to an effective judicial remedy, without prejudice to an available administrative or extrajudicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 DSGVO.

49      On the other hand, the data subject has Art. 80 para. 1 DSGVO the right to commission an institution, organization or association without profit intention under certain conditions, to file a complaint on its behalf or to exercise the rights mentioned in Art. 77 to 79 DGSVO. In addition, the Member States can, by type. 80 para. 2 DSGVO provide that any institution, organization or association, regardless of an order from the data subject in that Member State, has the right to lodge such a complaint with the supervisory authority and to exercise these rights if, in their opinion, the rights under this Regulation are a data subject has been injured as a result of processing personal data concerning them.

50      In the present case, it is apparent from the files available to the Court that ND, which operates a pharmacy, sells medicinal products that require pharmacies via Amazon and that customers order these medicinal products online, such as their name, delivery address and the information necessary for the individualization of the medicinal products have to enter. In the main proceedings, however, the action before a civil court was not brought under Art. 79 DSGVO from these customers who are affected persons within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO acts, still **according to Art. 80 DSGVO collected by an institution, organization or association – with or without a corresponding order from a data subject –,but from a competitor of this pharmacist from the point of view of the ban on unfair business practices due to the violations that this pharmacist is said to have committed against the provisions of the DSGVO.**

51      The main proceedings therefore raise the question of whether the DSGVO stands in the way of a competitor like DR, who is not a data subject within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 of this Ordinance is empowered to bring such an action before the national civil courts.

52      It should be noted that when interpreting a Union law provision, not only its wording, but also its context and the objectives pursued by the regulation to which it belongs must be taken into account (judgment of 12 January 2023, Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság, C ‑ 132/21, EU: C: 2023: 2, marg. 32).

53      With regard to the wording of the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO, it should be noted that none of these provisions expressly precludes a competitor of a company from the point of view of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices due to an alleged violation of this company by the obligations of the DSGVO Civil courts can bring an action against this company. From Art. 77 para. 1, Art. 78 para. 1 and Art. 79 para. 1 DSGVO, which in paragraph 48 of the present judgment, rather,that the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and the right to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority and against a controller or processor exist in accordance with these provisions „without prejudice to “ any other administrative, judicial or extrajudicial legal remedy.

54      Regarding the regulatory context of Chapter VIII DSGVO, it should be noted that this regulation contains in Chapter II material provisions which may include: a. include the principles for the processing of personal data (Art. 5) and the requirements for the legality of processing (Art. 6) and full respect, in particular that in Art. 16 para. 1 TFEU and Art. 8 of the Charter should ensure the fundamental right of data subjects to protect personal data. The fact that Chapter VIII DSGVO does not contain any provisions that provide that competitors of a company that is said to have violated these substantive provisions can bring an action for the failure to do so is due to the fact that – as stated by the Advocate General in point 80 of his Opinion executed – only affected persons,but these competitors are not the addressees of the protection of personal data guaranteed by this regulation.

55      However, if the violation of these material provisions is likely to have a primary impact on the persons affected by the data in question, it can also affect third parties. This is made clear by the fact that **Art. 82 para. 1 DSGVO for „any person who has suffered material or immaterial damage due to a violation of this regulation “, provides for a right to compensation. The Court has also already held that the breach of a personal data protection rule may at the same time violate consumer protection rules or unfair commercial practices** (judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 78) and an important indicator for the assessment of the question,whether an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Art. 102 TFEU exists (cf. in this sense judgment of 4. July 2023, Meta Platforms u. a. [General Terms of Use of a Social Network], C ‑ 252/21, EU: C: 2023: 537, marg. 47 and 62).

56      In this context, it should be noted that access to and exploitation of personal data is of considerable importance in the context of the digital economy. Access to personal data and the possibility of processing it have become an important parameter of competition between companies in the digital economy. In order to take into account the actual economic development and to maintain fair competition, it may therefore be necessary to take into account the provisions on the protection of personal data when enforcing competition law and the rules on unfair business practices (cf. in this sense judgment of 4 . July 2023, Meta Platforms u. a. [General Terms of Use of a Social Network], C ‑ 252/21, EU: C: 2023: 537, marg. 50 and 51).

57      It also results from Art. 1 para. 1 DSGVO in the light of recitals 9 and 13 of the regulation in particular that it should ensure a fundamentally complete harmonization of national legislation on the protection of personal data. However, several of their provisions explicitly give Member States the option of providing additional – stricter or restrictive – national regulations that give them discretion as to how they are implemented („ opening clauses “) (judgment of 28 . April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 57).

58      The Court has already found that this applies to Art. 80 para. 2 DSGVO applies, which leaves the Member States a margin of discretion with regard to its implementation and that of a national regulation, according to which an association for the protection of consumer interests against the alleged infringer of the protection of personal data without a corresponding order and regardless of the violation of specific rights of data subjects, in particular with the reason that the ban on unfair commercial practices has been violated does not conflict, provided that the data processing in question can affect the rights of identified or identifiable natural persons from this Ordinance (judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 59 and 83).

59      Although the provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO do not contain such a special opening clause that expressly allows Member States to allow competitors of a company that allegedly violates the substantive provisions of this Regulation to sue for failure to do so.

60      However, from the wording and context of the provisions of this Chapter VIII, which are set out in paragraphs 53 to 58 of this judgment, it follows that the Union legislature, by adopting this regulation, did not want to fully harmonize the legal remedies available in the event of a violation of the provisions of the DSGVO, and in particular did not want to exclude that competitors of a suspected infringer of personal data protection rules based on national law may bring an action from the point of view of banning unfair commercial practices.

61      This interpretation is confirmed by the goals pursued by the DSGVO. In particular, the tenth recital in the preamble to that regulation states that the processing of personal data ensures a uniform and high level of data protection for natural persons and that the obstacles to the movement of personal data in the Union are to be removed. The eleventh recital in the preamble to the regulation also states that effective protection of this data requires strengthening the rights of data subjects and tightening obligations for those who process and decide on personal data,as well as – in the member states – equal powers to monitor and ensure compliance with the regulations for the protection of personal data as well as the same sanctions in the event of their violation. The 13th According to the recital in the preamble to the regulation, in order to ensure a uniform level of data protection for natural persons in the Union and to eliminate differences that could hinder the free movement of personal data in the internal market, a regulation is necessary which creates legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, natural persons in all Member States with the same level of enforceable rights,provides for the same duties and responsibilities for those responsible and processors and ensures uniform control of the processing of personal data and equivalent sanctions in all Member States.

62      The possibility for a company's competitor to bring an action before the civil courts for the failure of a breach of the material provisions of DSGVO allegedly committed by that company from the point of view of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices does not only affect these objectives, but can even increase the practical effectiveness of these provisions and thus improve the high level of protection of data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data sought by this regulation.

63      On the one hand, an action for an injunction brought by a competitor against a company from the point of view of the prohibition of unfair business practices due to an alleged violation of the material provisions of the DSGVO has no influence whatsoever on the legal remedy system provided for in Chapter VIII of this Regulation or on the The aim is to ensure a uniform level of data protection for natural persons in the Union and differences, that could hinder the free movement of personal data in the internal market.

64      Such an action, albeit incidental, may be based on the violation of the same provisions of the DSGVO as that on which data subjects or an institution, organization or association within the meaning of Article 80 of this Ordinance pursuant to Articles 77 to 79 can support a complaint or an appeal.

65      However, firstly, a complaint brought by a competitor –, in contrast to Articles 77 to 80 DSGVO –, does not serve the aim of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data; rather, in the interests of this competitor in particular, fair competition should be ensured.

66      Secondly, there is the possibility of a competitor to bring such an action against the civil courts from the point of view of the prohibition of unfair business practices, in addition to the legal remedies pursuant to Art. 77 to 79 DSGVO, which are fully preserved and by the data subjects and, if applicable, by the Institutions, organizations or associations within the meaning of Art. 80 DSGVO can be taken at any time.

67      In particular, as stated by the **German government, the coexistence of data protection and competition law remedies does not pose a risk to the uniform enforcement of the DSGVO** . It follows from Articles 77 to 80 DGSVO that this regulation does not provide for priority or exclusive jurisdiction, nor does it give priority to the assessment of the aforementioned authority or the aforementioned court as to the existence of a violation of the rights conferred by the regulation (cf. in this sense judgment of 12 January 2023, Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság, C ‑ 132/21, EU: C: 2023: 2, marg. 35).As a result, the filing of an injunction by a competitor of the alleged infringer of personal data protection rules at civil courts does not affect the legal remedy system created by Chapter VIII DSGMO. In addition, as also explained by the German government, the Art. Preliminary rulings provided for in 267 TFEU ensure that the substantive provisions of the DSGVO, the supervisory authority and the courts seised on the basis of Articles 77 to 80 DSGVO on the one hand and those of such a competitor from the point of view of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices apply to the same violation on the other hand, be interpreted uniformly.

68      Thirdly, as the Advocate General essentially stated in point 104 of his Opinion, the aim is to ensure a uniform level of data protection for data subjects in the Union and to eliminate differences that could hinder the free movement of personal data in the internal market , not endangered by the fact that persons other than the data subjects and the institutions, organizations and associations according to Art. 80 DSGVO is given the opportunity to rely on the material provisions of the DSGVO. Even if individual Member States did not provide for this possibility, this would not lead to a fragmentation of the implementation of data protection in the Union, because the material provisions of the DSGVO for all responsible persons within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 7 DSGVO are equally binding and compliance with them is ensured by the legal remedies provided for in this regulation.

69      On the other hand, with the aim of ensuring effective protection of the data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data and the practical effectiveness of the material provisions of the DSGVO, it should be stated that –, as in paragraph. 65 of the present judgment, – is an action for an injunction brought by a competitor of the alleged infringer to protect personal data does not serve this purpose, but is intended to ensure fair competition; however, it undeniably contributes to compliance with these provisions and thus to strengthening the rights of data subjects and ensuring a high level of protection for them (cf. in this sense judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 74).

70      Moreover, such an action for an injunction by a competitor, similar to actions brought by associations to safeguard consumer interests, could prove to be particularly effective in ensuring this protection, since it enables numerous violations of the rights of persons affected by the processing of their personal data to be prevented (cf. in this sense judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 75).

71      It follows that the interpretation made in paragraph 60 of this judgment is in line with the requirements arising from Art. 16 para. 1 TFEU and Art. 8 of the Charter, and thus with the aim of the DSGVO to ensure effective protection of the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of natural persons and in particular a high level of protection for the right of every person to the protection of their personal data (cf. in this sense judgment of 28 April 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, C ‑ 319/20, EU: C: 2022: 322, marg. 73).

72      In the present case, it is for the referring court to examine whether the alleged breach of the substantive provisions of the DSGVO at issue in the main proceedings, if proven, also violates the prohibition on unfair commercial practices in accordance with the relevant national regulations .

73      In view of the foregoing, the answer to the first question must be that the **provisions of Chapter VIII DSGVO are to be interpreted as meaning that they do not conflict with a national regulation which** –, in addition to the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing this regulation and the legal protection options of the data subjects – **gives competitors of the alleged infringer of regulations for the protection of personal data the authority, for violations of the DSGVO against the infringer by means of a lawsuit before the civil courts** from the point of view of the ban on the conduct of unfair business practices.

## ***The second question***

74      With its second question, the referring court essentially wants to know whether Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are to be interpreted as meaning that in a case in which the operator of a pharmacy sells medicinal products subject to pharmacy via an online platform, data that his customers must enter when ordering these medicinal products online (such as B. Name, delivery address and information necessary for the individualization of the medicinal products), health data within the meaning of these provisions, even if the sale of these medicinal products does not require a medical prescription.

75      Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, which have a similar regulatory content, as far as the interpretation that the Court has to make (judgment of 1 August 2022, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601, marg. 58 and 117), and which, according to the heading of these articles, relate to the processing „of special categories “ personal data, establish the principle of prohibiting such. As in the 51st Recital to the DSGVO is expressly stated, personal data that is inherently particularly sensitive to fundamental rights and freedoms deserve special protection, since their processing can pose significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms.

76      On these special categories of personal data, which are described in Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and in Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are listed, also include health data. According to Art. 4 no. 15 DSGVO in connection with the 35th Recital to the Regulation all personal data that provide information about a natural person's past, present and future physical or mental health, including data relating to the provision of health services to that person.

77      In addition, it results in particular from Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO that the term „personal data “ includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person and that it is sufficient for a person „to be identifiable “ that they directly or indirectly, in particular by assigning it to an identifier such as a name, to an identification number, to physical characteristics, to an online identifier economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person can be identified.

78      If conclusions can be drawn about the state of health of an identified or identifiable person from the data on the purchase of medicinal products, they are health data in the sense of Art. 4 no. 15 DSGVO to view.

> 79      In the present case, it is apparent from the files available to the Court that ND **customers enter data such as their name, delivery address and information on the individualization of medicinal products when ordering pharmacies online via Amazon** . This information is undoubtedly „personal data “ because it affects identified or identifiable natural persons.
>

80      Under these circumstances, it must be determined whether this data relates to the state of health of these persons within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 15 DSGVO can be closed, and thus health data in the sense of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 represent DSGVO.

81      In this context, the Court has already ruled that, given the aim of Directive 95/46 and DSGVO, which is to ensure a high level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons –, in particular their private life – when processing to ensure personal data concerning them, the term „health data “ according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, the term „data on health “ in Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted broadly (cf. in this sense judgments of 6 November 2003, Lindqvist, C ‑ 101/01, EU: C: 2003: 596, marg. 50, and from 1 August 2022, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601, marg. 125).

82      In particular, these provisions cannot be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data, which can indirectly disclose sensitive information about a natural person, is exempt from the enhanced protection regulation provided for in these provisions, otherwise the practical effectiveness of this regulation and the protection it is intended of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons would be impaired (judgment of 1 August 2022, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601, marg. 127).

83      So that personal data as health data in the sense of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO can therefore be classified, it is sufficient that this data can be used to conclude the state of health of the data subject by means of a mental combination or derivation (cf. in this sense judgment of 1 August 2022, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601, marg. 123).

> **84      From the data that a customer enters when ordering pharmacy-only medicinal products via an online platform, the health status of the data subject can be combined or derived in the sense of Art. 4 no. 1 DSGVO are closed because the order establishes a connection between a drug, its therapeutic indications and applications and an identified or identifiable natural person by information such as the name or delivery address.**
>

85      However, the referring court asks whether the fact that no medical prescription is required for the sale of the ordered medicinal products is relevant insofar as the medicinal products in this case are not necessarily intended for the customer who orders them, but possibly for third parties.

86      For the purposes of applying Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO must be checked in the event that the operator of a pharmacy processes personal data as part of an activity carried out via an online platform, whether this data enables the disclosure of information that falls under one of the categories mentioned in these provisions, regardless of whether this information affects a user of this platform or another natural person. If this is the case, such processing of personal data is prohibited subject to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of these provisions (cf. in this sense judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms u. a. [General Terms of Use of a Social Network], C ‑ 252/21, EU: C: 2023: 537, marg. 68).

> 87      This basic **prohibition applies regardless of whether the information disclosed by the processing in question is correct or not** and whether the operator acts with the aim of obtaining information that is included in one of the Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 special categories mentioned DSGVO fall. In view of the **considerable risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of the data subjects, which result from any processing of personal data that fall under one of these categories, these regulations aim to ensure that such data processing is independent of its stated purpose and the accuracy** of the information concerned to ban (cf. in this sense judgment of 4. July 2023, Meta Platforms u. a. [General Terms of Use of a Social Network], C ‑ 252/21, EU:C: 2023: 537, marg. 69 and 70).
>

> **88      Accordingly, if a user of an online platform transmits personal data when ordering pharmacy-related but non-prescription medicinal products, the processing of this data by the operator of a pharmacy who sells these medicinal products via the online platform is a processing of health data in the sense of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, since the processing of this data can disclose information about the state of health of a natural person, regardless of whether this information concerns the user or another person for whom this order is made (cf. in this sense judgment of 4th July 2023, Meta Platforms u. a. [General Terms of Use of a Social Network], C ‑ 252/21, EU: C: 2023: 537,Marg. 73).**
>

89      An **interpretation of these provisions, which would differentiate according to the type of medicinal product concerned and whether its sale requires a medical prescription, would not be in line with the objective of a high level of protection** mentioned in paragraph 81 of this judgment. Such an interpretation would also be for the purpose of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, which consists in ensuring increased protection against data processing, which, as is particularly evident from the 51st Recital of the DSGVO shows that due to the special sensitivity of the data in question, a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter for respect for private life and for the protection of personal data (judgment of 1 August 2022,Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija, C ‑ 184/20, EU: C: 2022: 601, marg. 126 and the case law cited there).

90      As a result, the information that a pharmacy operator's customers enter when ordering pharmacies that are subject to pharmacy but **not require a prescription online provides health data in the sense of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, even if these medicinal products are only intended for these customers with a certain probability and not with absolute certaint** y.

91      Furthermore, even if such medicinal products are ordered for people other than customers, it cannot be ruled out that these persons can be identified and conclusions can be drawn about their state of health. This could e.g. B. be the case if the medicinal products are not delivered to the place of residence of the customer who ordered them, but to the place of residence of a third party, or if the customer is independent of the delivery address when ordering or as part of the associated communication another identifiable person, such as a family member. If identification and / or registration of the customer is required for the order, for example by creating a customer account or adding the customer to a loyalty program, it is also not excludedthat the information given by the customer in this context – can be used in particular in combination with information about the ordered medicinal products – in order to draw conclusions not only about his state of health, but also about that of a third party.

92      Finally, as in paragraph. 86 of the present judgment, the fact that information such as that at issue in the main proceedings prevents health data within the meaning of Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, not that they, as u. a. from the 53rd Recital of the DGSVO results, in particular in connection with the management of services and systems in the health sector, if one of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 2 of these provisions is met.

93      This can be the case above all if, on the one hand, in accordance with letter a of this paragraph 2 and subject to the exception provided there, the data subject expressly consents to the one or more processing of this personal data after the specific circumstances and purposes have been clearly stated , completely and in an easily understandable manner. **On the other hand, such processing can be carried out according to Art. 9 para. 2 letter h DSGVO may be permitted if it is necessary for health care purposes on the basis of Union law, the law of a Member State or on the basis of a contract with a healthcare professional.**

94      After all, the answer to the second question is that Art. 8 (1) of Directive 95/46 and Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are to be interpreted as meaning that in a case in which the operator of a pharmacy sells medicinal products subject to pharmacy via an online platform, data that his customers must enter when ordering these medicinal products online (such as B. Name, delivery address and information necessary for the individualization of the medicinal products), health data within the meaning of these provisions, even if the sale of these medicinal products does not require a medical prescription.

# **Cost**

95      For the parties to the main proceedings, the proceedings are part of the proceedings pending before the referring court; the decision on costs is therefore a matter for that court. Other interested parties' expenses for making statements to the Court of Justice are non-refundable.

# For these reasons, the Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) recognized:
