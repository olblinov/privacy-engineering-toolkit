- **EDPB Guidelines on scope of ePrivacy cookie rules** (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/edpb_guidelines_202302_technical_scope_art_53_eprivacydirective_en.pdf): The EDPB provides a brief clarification on technical scope of Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive. Importantly, it clarified that:
    - The information stored and accessed do not have to be put there by the same person. Even if the user was the source of the input, the information was accessed through the terminal equipment and, hence, subject to ePD.
    -  URL and pixel tracking are subject to ePrivacy rules. I'm seeing no reason not to extend the same logic to UTM (i.e. per-campaign, and not per-user URL tracking), but thankfully the EDPB did not go that far.

- **EDPB issues an Urgent Binding Decision banning behavioural advertising by Meta** (https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-urgent-binding-decision-processing-personal-data-behavioural-advertising-meta_en): EDPB adopted an urgent binding decision instructing the Irish (IE) DPA as lead supervisory authority (LSA) to take, within two weeks, final measures regarding Meta Ireland Limited (Meta IE) and to impose a ban on the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising on the legal bases of contract and legitimate interest across the entire European Economic Area (EEA). The EDPB takes note of Meta's proposal to rely on a consent based approach as legal basis, as it was reported on 30/10. The Irish DPC is currently evaluating this together with the Concerned Supervisory Authorities (CSAs).

- **Everyone's very concerned with Meta's paid option** (https://datenschutz-hamburg.de/news/geplantes-abomodell-bei-facebook-und-instagram, https://www.datatilsynet.dk/internationalt/internationalt-nyt/2023/nov/datatilsynet-foelger-udviklingen-i-metas-nye-betalingsmodel, https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/datatilsynet-folger-med-pa-metas-nye-losning/, https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay): The DPAs claim they're looking closely. NOYB has submitted a complaint with the Austrian DPA, referencing the excessive cost of subscription (EUR 251.88 / year) not allowing "free" consent as required by GDPR. 

- **Irish DPA reviews Airbnb photo id verification processes** (https://dataprotection.ie/en/resources/law/decisions/inquiry-airbnb-ireland-uc-28-september-2023, https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2023-11/Art%2060%20decision%20IN-22-9-2%20Redacted.Compressed.pdf): The DPC ruled on a handful of questions relating to Airbnb's user id verification procedure. Notable excerpts:
    - The overall idea of verifying people's identity is justified given that its users interact in the real world and there is significant interest in their safety. Ergo, LI is available.
    - However, to be able to  rely on LI, Airbnb has to first exhaust other less intrusive options of verification. 
    - Additionally, Airbnb could not have requested an unredacted id without breach of data minimization requirements.
    - Finally, retaining the copy of the id after verification was not justified by LI.

- **Google & Meta ordered to offer granular choice to cookies as well as full list of cookies** (https://digst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2023/november/digitaliseringsstyrelsen-giver-paabud-til-meta-og-google/, https://digst.dk/media/29337/paabud-til-google.pdf, https://digst.dk/media/29338/paabud-til-meta-platforms.pdf): The Danish regulator found Google & Meta in breach of cookie consent rules. Amongst others, it noted that the cookie banner spoke of 4 separate purposes, but granular choice was offered with respect to 2 only. The DPA said that it is impermissible to join several purposes into one overarching one. In addition, the DPA stated that following CJEU ruling in Planet49, a full list of cookies has to be presented and added that the expiration times for them have to be provided.

- **TikTok intends to challenge the €345M fine** (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:62023TN1030): The initial decision on fine was in connection with dark patterns on TikTok's app which nudged people into more prolific data sharing. See initial EDPB decision here: https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/following-edpb-decision-tiktok-ordered-eliminate-unfair-design-practices-concerning_en.

- **ICO suggests use of centralized phone numbers for couriers** (https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/we-looked-into-text-pests-and-heres-what-we-found/): People sometimes receive unwanted contact from 'text pests' after using services such as booking a taxi or ordering a pizza. The ICO suggested, among others, the following measures: allowing couriers to only view limited delivery and customer data, specifically first name and initial of the last name, and the delivery address. For real-time communication during delivery, for example if a courier can’t find the delivery address, couriers can call or message the customer. If opting for a call, temporary phone numbers appear at both ends to avoid disclosing their actual phone numbers, while messages are sent within the app.
