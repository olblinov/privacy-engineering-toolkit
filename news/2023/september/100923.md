# Week 4-10 Sep 2023

- **Norwegian court upholds emergency order to stop profiling in Meta's products** (https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/datatilsynet-vant-i-oslo-tingrett/): In August, Datatilsynet ordered a temporary ban on behavioral ads and profiling on Meta in light of the DPC and CJEU decisions. The Oslo court denied Meta's  request for an injunction against the ban.

- **Fidelity card-related EUR 300k fine for Italian company** (https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9910120, https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9909907): A customer's fidelity card was activated by an employee without the customer's consent, which the DPA regarded as violation of the integrity principle, leading to a data breach. In addition to that, the DPA found the company to be in breach of (1) transparency on transfer of data to Meta; (2) unclear and contradictory physical card, online card and cookie-banner information on processing; (3) lack of DPIA with respect to profiling; (4) lack of retention periods. About 2M people were affected, making the fine quite soft at 15 cents per person (in comparison, the usual fine for a data breach is about 3 euro per person).

- **ISO publishes a standard on consent records management** (https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html): Unfortunately, the standard is quite pricy at CHF187. From the previews available (e.g. https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/80392/9102635615bf4b88803e1dc61ba5944b/ISO-IEC-TS-27560-2023.pdf), it seems that the record schema is intended to be quite complicated and is quite a departure from previous recommendations by DPAs such as the ICO.
