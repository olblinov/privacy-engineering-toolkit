- **TikTok fined EUR 345M for processing of children's data** (https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/DPC-announces-345-million-euro-fine-of-TikTok, https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202302_ie_sa_ttl_children_en.pdf, https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-09/final_decision_tiktok_in-21-9-1_-_redacted_8_september_2023.pdf): The DPC found TT in violation of privacy by design and by default principles as (1) child accounts were public by default; (2) the Family Pairing feature allowed messaging between above 16 child users and non-child users who were not verified as their parents or guardians; (3) insufficient transparency was provided to children on third party recipients; and (4) dark patterns were used to nudge people into more privacy-intrusive options. The dark patterns are out-of-this-world. In the first instance, the screen presented two options: "Go private" or "Skip". Get this, the German DPA complained that Skip was located on the right side; internet users are used to right leading them to fulfil a step and go further (muscle memory). The second dark pattern concerned the fact that between "Cancel" and "Post Now" the latter was written in bold.

- **HIPAA Security Risk Assessment Tool available** (https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/security-risk-assessment-tool): The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology updated its tool for assessing security risks under HIPAA. The excel worksheet seems quite useful and easy to employ; I really like the sections, the questions and granularity of questions (and an indication if thats negotiable or required!). Awesome tool all around.
