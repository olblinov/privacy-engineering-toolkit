- **The Norwegian DPA issues guidance for employee monitoring** (https://www.datatilsynet.no/personvern-pa-ulike-omrader/personvern-pa-arbeidsplassen/overvaking-av-ansattes-bruk-av-elektronisk-utstyr/): BY default, employee surveillance is prohibited. There are, however, two exceptions to the ban: (1)  Managing the enterprise's computer network; and (2) Discovering or clearing security breaches in the network. Among others, DLP measures are allowed following a risk assessment. It is noted that it will then be forbidden to use the information collected to simultaneously investigate whether the employee has fulfilled his obligations under the employment contract.

- **NOYB complains against Fitbit for non-transparent data transfers** (https://noyb.eu/en/your-fitbit-useless-unless-you-consent-unlawful-data-sharing): NOYB complained against (1) forced consent to US-bound transfers upon creating an account; (2) no ability to opt-out of collecting and sharing with third parties "highly personal" data such as food, weight, sleep logs; (3) no ability to withdraw consent without deleting the account; (4) lack of response to access requests; (5) the Privacy Notice does and the consent do not include the non-EEA countries where the data is being transferred to; (6) consent cannot be relied upon for systematic transfers; and (7) relying on consent and SCCs simultaneously is unfair.
