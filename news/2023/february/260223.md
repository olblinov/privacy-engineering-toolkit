- **US Adequacy decision blocked by implementation of redress mechanism in the US** (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-02/20230117plenfinalminutes74thplenarymeeting_en.pdf): European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders stated that the draft EU-US adequacy decision will not enter into force until EU data subjects have access to the new redress mechanism and the internal rules and procedures of intelligence agencies have been updated to implement the Executive Orderâ€™s requirements. No specific deadlines were provided.

- **EDPB approved 3 sets of guidelines: Chapter V & Art.3 interplay, certification as tool of transfer, dark patterns** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-publishes-three-guidelines-following-public-consultation_en): Very angry at EDPB for not releasing redline versions. In comparison to initial versions, the Chapter V interplay guidelines (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-02/edpb_guidelines_05-2021_interplay_between_the_application_of_art3-chapter_v_of_the_gdpr_v2_en_0.pdf) were supplemented by clarifications, most notably the responsibilities of the controller when the data exporter is a processor.

As to the dark patterns guidelines (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-02/edpb_03-2022_guidelines_on_deceptive_design_patterns_in_social_media_platform_interfaces_v2_en_0.pdf), some clarifications were added, for example on how to integrate the guidelines in the design thinking process and a second Annex  was added, providing a quick overview of all the best practices.

- **4.9M fine in Italy for unlawful marketing** (https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9856345): The company made phone calls to potential customers. The violations found include: (1) not carrying out all activities described in the privacy notice; (2) failures of privacy by design, including failure to collect consent, keep informed, ensure quality of data; (3) collection of consent for marketing & profiling with one action, making the consent unspecific & not free; (4) lack of direct and simplified procedures to enable the data subject to exercise their right to object. Historically, Italy has been big on punishing consent-less direct marketing; wondering how much of the fine amount is associated with lack of consent vs. other violations.

- **Massive EUR913k fine for DSR failure in Norway in response to 4 complaints** (https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/f974410ee2e142c99cfc208cbae7634e/administrative-fine---sats-asa.pdf): the company failted to act timely upon 2 data subject access requests; 3 times it did not promtly delete data; did not properly inform about data retention policy concerning the personal data of banned members; and failing to rely on a valid lawful basis to process the training history data of the members of its fitness centres.

Notably, Chapter V was not included into the list of violations.

- **Danish DPA conditionally approves paid cookie walls** (https://www.datatilsynet.dk/hvad-siger-reglerne/vejledning/cookies/cookie-walls): Similarly to Germany, the Danish DPA states that under certain circumstances paid cookie walls are allowed. The criteria are: (1) the service should be essentially similar (e.g. no significant difference in content); (2) the fee has to be reasonable; (3) companies need to be able to demonstrate that the additional purposes are necesssary as an alternative to payment. Surprisingly, ads cookies are safe, while analytics shall be regarded with increased care; (4) in case of payment, no such additional processing shall take place.
