# The legal framework

## Union law

3         Recitals 4 to 8, 10, 35, 51 to 53, 75 and 146 of the GDPR are worded as follows:

“(4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve humanity. The right to protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and weighed against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognized by the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], enshrined in the Treaties, in particular respect for private and family life, [...] ] the protection of personal data, [...]

(5) Economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. Exchanges of personal data between public and private actors, including individuals, associations and businesses, have intensified across the [European] Union. Union law calls on national authorities of Member States to cooperate and exchange personal data, in order to be able to fulfill their missions or to carry out tasks on behalf of an authority of a other Member State.

(6) Rapid technological developments and globalization have created new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technologies enable both private companies and public authorities to use personal data in their activities like never before. Increasingly, individuals are making information about themselves publicly and globally available. Technologies have transformed both the economy and social relations, and they should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and their transfer to third countries and international organizations, while ensuring a high level of protection of personal data.

(7) These developments require a robust and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, accompanied by rigorous application of the rules, as it is important to create the trust which will allow the digital economy to develop in the entire internal market. Natural persons should have control over personal data concerning them. Both legal and practical security should be strengthened for individuals, economic operators and public authorities.

(8) Where this Regulation provides that the law of a Member State may provide clarifications or limitations to the rules it provides, Member States may incorporate elements of this Regulation into their law to the extent necessary to ensure the consistency and to make national provisions understandable to the people to whom they apply.

[...]

(10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove obstacles to the flow of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons within the Union The processing of these data should be equivalent in all Member States.

[...]

(51) Personal data which are, by nature, particularly sensitive from the point of view of fundamental rights and freedoms deserve specific protection, because the context in which they are processed could create significant risks for these freedoms and rights. [...] In addition to the specific requirements applicable to such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing. Exceptions to the general prohibition on processing these special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided for, inter alia where the data subject gives explicit consent or to meet specific needs [...]

(52) Derogations from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be permitted where Union law or the law of a Member State so provides, and subject to appropriate safeguards, in a manner to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where the public interest so requires, in particular the processing of personal data in the field of labor law and social protection law, including pensions, and for security, health surveillance and alert purposes, prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. These exemptions are possible for health purposes, including public health and the management of health care services, in particular to ensure the quality and efficiency of the procedures for settling claims for benefits and services in the scheme. health insurance, or for archival purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes. [...]

(53) Special categories of personal data which deserve higher protection should only be processed for health-related purposes, where necessary to achieve those purposes in the interest of individuals and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health care or social protection services and systems, including the processing, by the managing authorities and national central health authorities, of these data, with a view to control of the quality, information of managers and general supervision, at national and local level, of the health care or social protection system and with a view to ensuring the continuity of health care or social protection [...]. This Regulation should therefore provide for harmonized conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data relating to health, to meet specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes. by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union law or the law of the Member States should provide for specific and appropriate measures to protect the fundamental rights and personal data of natural persons. Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or health data. [...]

[...]

(75) Risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, varying in degree of probability and severity, may arise from the processing of personal data which is likely to result in physical, material or moral harm, in particular particular: when the processing may give rise to discrimination, theft or identity theft, financial loss, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of data protected by professional secrecy, reversal unauthorized pseudonymization process or any other significant economic or social damage; where data subjects could be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; when the processing concerns [...] data concerning health [...]; when personal aspects are evaluated, in particular in the context of the analysis or prediction of elements concerning work performance, economic situation, health, [...] with a view to creating or using profiles individual; [...]

[...]

(146) The controller or processor should compensate any damage that a person may suffer as a result of processing carried out in violation of this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exonerated from liability if they prove that the damage is in no way attributable to them. The concept of damage should be interpreted broadly, in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice, in a manner which takes full account of the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any action for damages based on an infringement of other rules of Union law or the law of a Member State. Processing carried out in violation of this Regulation also includes processing carried out in violation of delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and the law of a Member State specifying the rules of this Regulation.

## German law

17       Under Article 275(1) of the Sozialgesetzbuch, Fünftes Buch (Social Code, Fifth Book), in the version applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings, the compulsory health insurance funds are required to request a Medizinischer Dienst (medical service) which assists them, in particular, to carry out an expertise aimed at removing doubts about the incapacity for work of an insured person, in cases determined by law or when the latter's illness requires it.

18       Article 278(1) of that code provides that such a medical service is established in each of the Länder, in the form of a body governed by public law.

# The main dispute and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling

19       The MDK Nordrhein is a body governed by public law which, as a medical service of health insurance funds, has the legal mission, among other things, of carrying out medical assessments aimed at dispelling doubts relating to the incapacity for work of persons insured with compulsory health insurance funds which come under its jurisdiction, including when these assessments concern its own employees.

20       In such a case, only the members of a special unit, called “special cases cell”, are authorized to process the so-called “social” data of this employee, using a locked domain of the computer system of this organization, and to access the digital archives, after the expert file has been closed. An internal memo relating to these cases provides, in particular, that a restricted number of authorized agents, including certain IT department agents, have access to said data.

21       The applicant in the main proceedings worked in the IT department of MDK Nordrhein, before being placed on incapacity for work for medical reasons. At the end of the semester during which this organization, as employer, continued to pay him, the compulsory health insurance fund to which he was affiliated began to pay him sickness benefit.

22       This fund then asked MDK Nordrhein to carry out an expert report on the incapacity for work of the applicant in the main proceedings. A doctor working within the “special cases unit” of MDK Nordrhein carried out the assessment, in particular, by obtaining information from the applicant's treating doctor in the main proceedings. When the latter was informed of this by his attending physician, he contacted one of his colleagues in the IT department and asked her to take, then send him, photographs of the expert report which appeared in the digital archives from MDK Nordrhein.

>23       Considering that data concerning his health had thus been the subject of unlawful processing by his employer, the applicant in the main proceedings asked the latter to pay him compensation in the amount of 20,000 euros, which the MDK Nordrhein refused.

>24       Subsequently, the applicant in the main proceedings brought an action before the Arbeitsgericht Düsseldorf (labor court, Düsseldorf, Germany) with a view to obtaining, on the basis of Article 82(1) of the GDPR and provisions of German law , that MDK Nordrhein be ordered to compensate for the damage it claims to have suffered as a result of the processing of personal data thus carried out. He essentially argued, on the one hand, that the **expertise in question should have been carried out by another medical service to prevent his colleagues from having access to data concerning his health and, on the other hand, that the measures of security surrounding the archiving of the report relating to this expertise was insufficient**. He also claimed that this processing constituted a violation of the legal rules protecting such data which had caused him both moral and material damage.

25       In defense, MDK Nordrhein mainly maintained that the collection and storage of data concerning the health of the applicant in the main proceedings had been carried out in compliance with the provisions relating to the protection of such data.

26       Having had his application dismissed at first instance, the applicant in the main proceedings appealed to the Landesarbeitsgericht Düsseldorf (Higher Labor Court, Düsseldorf, Germany), which also dismissed his appeal. He then lodged an appeal on a point of law before the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labor Court, Germany), which is the referring court in the present case.

27       The latter court starts from the premises according to which, in the main dispute, the expertise carried out by the MDK Nordrhein, as a medical service, constitutes "processing" of "personal data" and, more specifically, of " data concerning health", within the meaning of Article 4, points 1, 2 and 15, of the GDPR, so that this operation falls within the material scope of this regulation, as defined in Article 2, paragraph 1, of this one. Furthermore, it considers that MDK Nordrhein is the “data controller” concerned, within the meaning of Article 4(7) of that regulation.

28       His questions relate, firstly, to the interpretation of several provisions of Article 9 of the GDPR, which relates to processing relating to particular categories of personal data, in particular taking into account the fact that the processing in question in the main proceedings was carried out by an organization which is also the employer of the person concerned, as defined in Article 4, point 1, of that regulation.

29       First of all, the referring court doubts whether the processing of data concerning health at issue in the main proceedings could fall within one of the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the GDPR. According to that court, only the exceptions set out in points (b) and (h) of paragraph 2 are relevant in this case. However, it immediately excludes the application of the derogation provided for in point b) in the present case, on the grounds that the processing at issue in the main proceedings was not necessary for the purposes of the rights and obligations of the controller. , taken in its capacity as employer of the person concerned. In fact, this treatment would have been initiated by another organization, which asked MDK Nordrhein to carry out an inspection in its capacity as a medical service. On the other hand, while being inclined not to apply the exemption provided for in this point h), because it seems to it that only processing carried out by a "neutral third party" should be able to fall under it and that an organization cannot rely on its “dual function” as employer and medical service to rule out the ban on such treatment, the referring court is not categorical in this regard.

30       Next, in the event that the processing of data concerning health would be authorized in such circumstances under Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, the referring court questions the rules relating to the protection of health data which must be respected in this context. In its view, this regulation implies that it is not sufficient for the controller to satisfy the requirements set out in Article 9(3) thereof. This manager should, moreover, guarantee that none of the data subject's colleagues can have any access to data concerning the latter's state of health.

31       Finally, still in the same hypothesis, this court wishes to know whether at least one of the conditions referred to in Article 6(1) of the GDPR must, in addition, be met for such processing to be lawful. According to it, this should be the case and, in the context of the main proceedings, only points c) and e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) could a priori be relevant. However, these two points c) and e) should not apply, on the grounds that the treatment concerned is not “necessary”, within the meaning of these provisions, because it could just as easily be carried out by another medical service than the MDK Nordrhein.

32       Secondly, in the event that a violation of the GDPR is constituted in this case, the referring court questions the compensation possibly owed to the applicant in the main proceedings under Article 82 of that regulation.

33       On the one hand, it wishes to know whether the rule provided for in Article 82(1) of the GDPR has a dissuasive or punitive character, in addition to its remedial function, and, if so, whether it should be taken into account take that character into account when setting the amount of damages awarded for non-pecuniary damage, in particular having regard to the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and equivalence enshrined in other areas of Union law.

34       On the other hand, this court tends to consider that the liability of the controller can be engaged on the basis of Article 82(1), without the need to establish that he has committed a fault. However, having doubts, mainly in the light of rules of German law, it wonders whether it would be necessary to verify that the violation of the GDPR in question is attributable to the controller due to an intentional act or negligence on his part. and whether the level of seriousness of the fault possibly committed by the latter should influence the damages awarded in compensation for moral harm.

35       In those circumstances, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labor Court) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:

>1) Must Article 9(2)(h) of the [GDPR] be interpreted as meaning that it prohibits the medical service of a health insurance fund from processing data **concerning the health of one of its employees**, on whom the assessment of this employee's working capacity depends?

>2) In the event that the Court answers the first question in the negative, such that an exemption from the prohibition of processing of data concerning health set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR would be considered, pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, in a case such as this, in addition to the conditions set out in Article 9(3) of the GDPR, what other data protection requirements must be complied with and, if so, which ones?

>3) In the event that the Court answers the first question in the negative, such that an exemption from the prohibition of processing of data concerning health set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR would be considered, pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, in a case such as this, does the lawfulness of the processing of data concerning health also depend on compliance with at least one of the conditions set out in Article 6(1) of the GDPR?

>4) Is Article 82(1) of the GDPR of a special or general preventive nature and should this be taken into account for the assessment of the compensable moral damage that the controller or sub-processor the contractor is required to make repairs on the basis of this provision?

>5) Does the **degree of seriousness of the fault of the controller or processor influence the assessment** of the moral damage compensable on the basis of Article 82(1) of the GDPR? More particularly, can an absence of fault or a slight fault on the part of the data controller or the subcontractor be held in his defense? »

# On the preliminary questions

## On the first question

36       By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, having regard to the prohibition on processing data concerning health provided for in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, paragraph 2(h) , of this article must be interpreted as meaning that the exception it provides is applicable to situations in which a medical control body processes data concerning the health of one of its employees in a capacity not as an employer, but of medical service, in order to assess the work capacity of this employee.

37       According to settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of Union law requires taking into account not only its terms, but also the context in which it occurs as well as the objectives and purpose pursued by the provision. act of which she is part. The genesis of a provision of Union law may also reveal elements relevant to its interpretation (judgment of 16 March 2023, Towercast , C‑449/21, EU:C:2023:207, paragraph 31 and case law cited) .

38       First of all, it should be remembered that Article 9 of the GDPR concerns, as its title indicates, the “processing of special categories of personal data”, also referred to as “sensitive” data. recitals 10 and 51 of this regulation.

39       Recital 51 of the GDPR states that personal data which are, by nature, particularly sensitive from the point of view of fundamental rights and freedoms deserve specific protection, because the context in which they are processed could give rise to significant risks for these freedoms and these rights.

40       Thus, Article 9(1) of the GDPR establishes the principle of prohibiting processing of the special categories of personal data it lists. Among the latter are 'data concerning health', as defined in Article 4(15) of that regulation, read in the light of recital 35 thereof, which are referred to in the present case.

41       The Court clarified that the purpose of Article 9(1) of that regulation consists of ensuring increased protection against processing which, due to the particular sensitivity of the data subject to it, is likely to constitute interference particularly serious in the fundamental rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, guaranteed in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights [see, to this effect, judgment of June 5, 2023, Commission/Poland (Independence and private life of judges) , C‑204/21, EU:C:2023:442, paragraph 345 and case law cited].

42       Article 9(2)(a) to (j) of the GDPR provides, however, an exhaustive list of exceptions to the principle of prohibiting the processing of such sensitive data.

43       In particular, Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR authorizes such processing if it is 'necessary for the purposes [in particular] of assessing the worker's working capacity [...] on on the basis of Union law, the law of a Member State or under a contract concluded with a healthcare professional. This provision specifies that any processing based on it is, moreover, specifically “subject to the conditions and guarantees referred to in paragraph 3” of this article 9.

44       It follows from Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of that article, that the possibility of processing sensitive data, such as those concerning health, is strictly regulated by a series of cumulative conditions. The latter relate, firstly, to the purposes listed in point (h) – among which is the assessment of a worker's working capacity –, secondly, to the legal basis of this processing – whether it concerns the right to the Union, the law of a Member State or a contract concluded with a health professional, according to the same point (h) – and finally, thirdly, to the duty of confidentiality to which the persons authorized to carry out such treatment, under this Article 9(3), these persons must all be subject to an obligation of secrecy in accordance with the latter provision.

45       As the Advocate General noted, in substance, in points 32 and 33 of his conclusions, neither the wording of Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR nor the genesis of this provision do not provide elements such as to consider that the application of the derogation provided for in the said provision would be reserved, as the referring court suggests, for cases where the processing is carried out by a “neutral third party and not by the employer” of the data subject, as defined in Article 4(1) of this Regulation.

46       Having regard to the opinion of the referring court according to which, in essence, an organization should not be able to rely on its "double function" as employer of the person concerned and medical service to escape the principle of prohibition on processing data concerning health, set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, it should be clarified that it is decisive to take into consideration the title for which the processing of these data is carried out.

47       Indeed, if Article 9(1) prohibits, in principle, the processing of data concerning health, paragraph 2 of that article provides, in points (a) to (j), ten derogations which are independent of each other. and which must therefore be appreciated independently. It follows that the fact that the conditions for application of one of the derogations provided for in this paragraph 2 are not met cannot prevent a data controller from being able to take advantage of another derogation mentioned in this provision.

48       It follows from the above that Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of that article, in no way excludes the applicability of the exception set out in point h ) to situations in which a medical control body processes data concerning the health of one of its employees as a medical service, and not as an employer, in order to assess the work capacity of this employee.

49       Secondly, such an interpretation is supported by taking into account the system in which Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR forms part as well as by the objectives pursued by this regulation and this provision.

50       First, of course, insofar as it provides for an exception to the principle of the prohibition of the processing of special categories of personal data, Article 9(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted restrictively [judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and others (General conditions of use of a social network) , C‑252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 76].

51       However, compliance with the principle of prohibition set out in Article 9(1) of the GDPR cannot lead to reducing the scope of application of another provision of this regulation in a manner which would run counter to of the clear wording of the latter. However, the suggested interpretation, according to which the scope of application of the exception provided for in Article 9(2)(h), should be limited to cases where a “neutral third party” processes data concerning health for the purposes of the assessment of a worker's capacity for work, would add a requirement which is in no way apparent from the clear wording of the latter provision.

52       In this regard, it is irrelevant that in this case, in the event that MDK Nordrhein is prohibited from fulfilling its medical service mission when it concerns one of its own employees, a another medical control body would be able to take care of this. It is important to emphasize that this alternative, mentioned by the referring court, is not necessarily present or feasible in all Member States and in all situations likely to be covered by Article 9(2)(h) , of the GDPR. However, the interpretation of that provision cannot be guided by considerations drawn from the health system of a single Member State or arising from circumstances specific to the dispute in the main proceedings.

53       Secondly, the interpretation appearing in paragraph 48 of this judgment is consistent with the objectives of the GDPR and those of Article 9 of that regulation.

54       Thus, recital 4 of the GDPR states that the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, since it must be considered in relation to one's function in society and be weighed against other factors. other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality (see, to this effect, judgment of 22 June 2023, Pankki S , C‑579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph 78). In addition, the Court has already emphasized that the mechanisms allowing a fair balance to be found between the different rights and interests present are enshrined in the GDPR itself (see, to this effect, judgment of June 17, 2021, MICM , C‑ 597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph 112).

55       These considerations apply even when the data concerned fall into the particular categories referred to in Article 9 of this regulation [see, to this effect, judgment of 24 September 2019, GC and others (Dereferencing of sensitive data) , C‑136 /17, EU:C:2019:773, points 57 and 66 to 68], such as health data.

56       More specifically, it appears from recital 52 of the GDPR that “exemptions from the prohibition on processing these particular categories of data” should be authorized “when the public interest so requires, in particular [...] in the field of law labor and social protection law,” as well as “for health purposes, [...] in particular to ensure the quality and efficiency of procedures for settling claims for benefits and services in the scheme health insurance ". Recital 53 of this regulation also states that processing carried out “for health-related purposes” should be possible “where necessary to achieve those purposes in the interest of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the framework of the management of health care or social protection services and systems.

57       It is in this overall perspective and having regard to the various legitimate interests present that the Union legislature has provided, in Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, a possibility of derogating from the principle of the prohibition of the processing of data concerning health set out in paragraph 1 of this article, provided that the processing concerned satisfies the conditions and guarantees expressly imposed by this point (h) and by the other relevant provisions of this regulation, in particular paragraph 3 of that Article 9, provisions which do not contain the requirement that a medical service which processes such data under that point (h) is an entity separate from the employer of the data subject.

58       Taking into account the foregoing reasons, and without prejudice to the answers which will be given to the second and third questions, the answer to the first question should be that Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR must be interpreted as follows: meaning that the exception provided for in this provision is applicable to situations in which a medical control body processes data concerning the health of one of its employees in the capacity not of employer, but of medical service, in order to assess the working capacity of that employee, provided that the processing concerned satisfies the conditions and guarantees expressly imposed by this point (h) and by paragraph 3 of said Article 9.

## On the second question

59       According to the referring court, it is apparent from recitals 35, 51, 53 and 75 of the GDPR that it is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 9(3) thereof, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, where the controller is also the employer of the person whose work capacity is assessed. This regulation would also require that all employees of the data controller who have any professional contact with this person be excluded from the processing of data concerning health. According to this court, any data controller with several establishments, such as MDK Nordrhein, should ensure that the entity responsible for processing data concerning the health of the controller's employees always comes under an establishment other than the one in which the employee concerned works. Furthermore, the obligation of professional secrecy imposed on employees authorized to process such data would not, in fact, prevent a colleague of the data subject from accessing the data concerning him or her, which would entail risks of damage. , such as damage to the reputation of the latter.

60       In these conditions, by its second question, the referring court wishes, in essence, to know whether the provisions of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the controller of data processing concerning health, based on Article 9 , paragraph 2(h), of that regulation, is required to ensure that no colleague of the person concerned can access data relating to the person's state of health.

61       It should be recalled that, under Article 9(3) of the GDPR, processing relating to data and aimed at the purposes respectively listed in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2(h) of that Article 9, in this case data concerning the health of a worker for the purposes of assessing his capacity to work, can only be carried out if these data are processed by a health professional subject to an obligation of professional secrecy in accordance with Union law, the law of a Member State or the rules adopted by the competent national bodies, or under its responsibility, or by another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy in accordance with Union law or the law of a Member State or the rules adopted by the competent national bodies.

62       By adopting Article 9(3) of that regulation, which refers specifically to paragraph 2(h) of the same article, the Union legislature defined the specific protective measures which it intended to impose on those responsible such processing, which consists of the latter being reserved for persons subject to an obligation of secrecy, in accordance with the conditions detailed in said paragraph 3. There is therefore no need to add to the wording of this last provision requirements which it does not mention.

63       It follows, as the Advocate General noted, in substance, in point 43 of his conclusions, that Article 9(3) of the GDPR cannot serve as a legal basis for a measure guaranteeing that no colleague of the person concerned can access data relating to their state of health.

64       It must, however, be assessed whether the requirement consisting in guaranteeing that no colleague of the data subject has access to data relating to the person's state of health can be imposed on the controller of data processing. health data, based on Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, on the basis of another provision of this regulation.

65       In that regard, it is important to clarify that the only possibility for Member States to add such a requirement, in relation to those set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 9 of that regulation, lies in the option explicitly conferred on them paragraph 4 of this article to “maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing [...] of data concerning health”.

66       However, these possible additional conditions result not from the provisions of the GDPR themselves, but, where applicable, from rules of national law governing processing of this type, rules with regard to which this regulation expressly leaves a margin of discretion. appreciation to the Member States (see, to this effect, judgment of 30 March 2023, Hauptpersonalrat der Lehrerinnen und Lehrer , C‑34/21, EU:C:2023:270, paragraphs 51 and 78).

67       It should, moreover, be emphasized that a Member State which intends to make use of the option available in Article 9(4) of that regulation must, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, ensure that the practical consequences, in particular of an organizational, economic and medical nature, generated by the additional requirements with which this State intends to impose compliance, are not excessive for those responsible for such treatment, who do not necessarily have dimensions or technical and human resources which are sufficient to meet these requirements. In fact, these cannot harm the useful effect of the processing authorization which is expressly provided for in Article 9(2)(h) of the same regulation and framed in paragraph 3 of that article.

68       Finally, it is important to emphasize that, by virtue of Article 32(1)(a) and (b) of the GDPR, which gives effect to the principles of integrity and confidentiality set out in Article 5(1)(b), f), of this regulation, any person responsible for the processing of personal data is required to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, in particular the pseudonymization and encryption of such data, as well as means to guarantee, in particular, the confidentiality and integrity of processing systems and services. To determine the practical arrangements for this obligation, the controller must, in accordance with this Article 32(1), take into account the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and the purposes of the processing as well as the risks, the degree of probability and severity of which varies, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

69       It will, however, be up to the referring court to assess whether all of the technical and organizational measures implemented, in this case, by the MDK Nordrhein comply with the requirements of Article 32(1), under a) and b), of the GDPR.

> 70       The answer to the second question must therefore be that Article 9(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the controller of data processing concerning health, based on Article 9(3), 2(h) of that regulation, is not required, under those provisions, to ensure that no colleague of the data subject can access data relating to that person's state of health. However, such an obligation may be imposed on the controller of such processing either by virtue of regulations adopted by a Member State on the basis of Article 9(4) of that regulation, or by virtue of the principles of integrity and confidentiality set out in Article 5(1)(f) of the same regulation and concretized in Article 32(1)(a) and (b) thereof.

## On the third question

71       By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 9(2)(h) and Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted in this sense that processing of data concerning health based on this first provision must, in order to be lawful, not only comply with the requirements arising from it, but also fulfill at least one of the conditions of lawfulness set out in this first provision. Article 6, paragraph 1.

72       In this regard, it should be recalled that Articles 5, 6 and 9 of the GDPR appear in Chapter II of that regulation, entitled “Principles”, and relate, respectively, to the principles relating to the processing of personal data personal data, the conditions of lawfulness of the processing and the processing relating to particular categories of personal data.

73       Furthermore, it should be noted that recital 51 of the GDPR explicitly states that, '[o]ther than the specific requirements' applicable to processing operations relating to 'particularly sensitive' data, which are set out in Article 9(2) and 3, of this regulation, without prejudice to any measures possibly adopted by a Member State on the basis of paragraph 4 of this article, "the general principles and other rules of [the said] regulation should [also] apply [to such processing], in particular with regard to the conditions of lawfulness of the processing", as they emerge from Article 6 of the same regulation.

74       Therefore, in accordance with Article 6(1), first subparagraph, of the GDPR, processing relating to “particularly sensitive” data, such as those concerning health, is only lawful if at least one of the conditions set out in points (a) to (f) of paragraph 1, first subparagraph, are met.

75       However, the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation provides an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which processing of personal data may be considered lawful. Thus, for it to be considered legitimate, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in this provision [judgment of July 4, 2023, Meta Platforms and others (General conditions of use of a social network) , C ‑252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 90 as well as the case law cited].

76       Accordingly, the Court has repeatedly ruled that any processing of personal data must comply with the principles relating to data processing set out in Article 5(1) of the GDPR and satisfy the conditions for lawfulness of the processing listed in Article 5(1) of the GDPR. Article 6 of that regulation (judgment of 4 May 2023, Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Judicial electronic mailbox) , C‑60/22, EU:C:2023:373, paragraph 57 and case law cited).

77       Furthermore, it has already been held that, to the extent that Articles 7 to 11 of the GDPR, which appear, like Articles 5 and 6 thereof, in Chapter II of this regulation, have the effect of purpose of clarifying the scope of the obligations incumbent on the controller under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) of that Regulation, the processing of personal data, in order to to be lawful, must also respect, as is apparent from the case law of the Court, these other provisions of the said chapter which concern, in substance, consent, the processing of particular categories of personal data of a sensitive nature and the processing of relating to criminal convictions and offenses (judgment of 4 May 2023, Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Judicial electronic mailbox) , C‑60/22, EU:C:2023:373, paragraph 58 and case law cited).

78       It follows, in particular, that, to the extent that Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR aims to clarify the scope of the obligations incumbent on the controller under Article 5 , paragraph 1(a), and Article 6(1) of that regulation, processing of health data which is based on that first provision must comply, in order to be lawful, with both the requirements arising therefrom as well as the obligations resulting from the latter two provisions and, in particular, fulfill at least one of the conditions of lawfulness set out in Article 6(1).

> 79       Having regard to the above, the answer to the third question must be that Article 9(2)(h) and Article 6(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that processing health data based on that first provision must, in order to be lawful, not only comply with the requirements arising therefrom, but also fulfill at least one of the conditions of lawfulness set out in that Article 6(1).

## On the fourth question

80       By its fourth question, the referring court wishes to know, in essence, whether Article 82(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the right to compensation provided for in that provision not only fulfills a compensatory function, but also a dissuasive or punitive function and, if so, whether the latter must possibly be taken into account when determining the amount of damages awarded in compensation for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of that provision.

81       It should be recalled that Article 82(1) of the GDPR states that “[a]ny person who has suffered material or moral damage as a result of a violation of this regulation has the right to obtain from the controller or the subcontractor compensation for the damage suffered.

82       The Court interpreted this provision in the sense that the simple violation of the GDPR is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation, after having highlighted, in particular, that the existence of “damage” or “prejudice » having been “suffered” constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation provided for in this Article 82, paragraph 1, as does the existence of a violation of this regulation and a causal link between this damage and this violation , these three conditions being cumulative (see, to this effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post (Non-pecuniary damage linked to the processing of personal data) , C‑300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs 32 and 42 ].

83       Furthermore, the Court held that, since the GDPR does not contain a provision intended to define the rules relating to the assessment of damages due under the right to compensation enshrined in Article 82 of that regulation , national judges must to this end apply, by virtue of the principle of procedural autonomy, the internal rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of Union law, as defined by the Court's consistent case-law [see, to this effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post (Non-material damage linked to the processing of personal data) , C‑300/21, EU:C:2023:370, points 53, 54 and 59].

84       In this context and having regard to recital 146, sixth sentence, of the GDPR, according to which this instrument aims to ensure "complete and effective compensation for the damage suffered", the Court noted that, taking into account the compensatory function of the right compensation provided for in Article 82 of this regulation, financial compensation based on this article must be considered to be "complete and effective" if it allows full compensation for the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of said regulation, without it is necessary, for the purposes of such full compensation, to impose the payment of punitive damages [see, to this effect, judgment of May 4, 2023, Österreichische Post (Non-pecuniary damage linked to the processing of personal data) , C ‑300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs 57 and 58].

85       In this regard, it is important to emphasize that Article 82 of the GDPR has not a punitive but a compensatory function, unlike other provisions of this regulation also appearing in Chapter VIII thereof, namely its Articles 83 and 84, which have, for their part, essentially a punitive purpose, since they respectively allow the imposition of administrative fines as well as other sanctions. The articulation between the rules set out in said article 82 and those set out in said articles 83 and 84 demonstrates that there is a difference between these two categories of provisions, but also a complementarity, in terms of incentive to respect the GDPR, it being observed that the right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules provided for by this regulation and is likely to discourage the repetition of unlawful behavior [see, to this effect, judgment of May 4, 2023, Österreichische Post (Non-pecuniary damage linked to the processing of personal data) , C‑300/21, EU:C:2023:370, points 38 and 40].

86       Since the right to compensation provided for in Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not fulfill a dissuasive or even punitive function, as envisaged by the referring court, the seriousness of the violation of that regulation having caused the damage concerned cannot influence the amount of damages awarded under this provision, even when the damage is not material but moral. It follows that this amount cannot be set at a level exceeding full compensation for this damage.

> 87       Consequently, the answer to the fourth question must be that Article 82(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the **right to compensation provided for in that provision fulfills a compensatory function**, in that a Financial compensation based on that provision must make it possible to fully compensate for the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of this regulation, and **not have a dissuasive or punitive function**.

## On the fifth question

88       It appears from the information transmitted by the referring court, in response to a request for clarification addressed to it in accordance with Article 101 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, that the fifth question seeks to determine, on the one hand , if the existence and/or proof of a fault are conditions required for the liability of the controller or the subcontractor to be engaged and, on the other hand, what repercussion the degree of seriousness of a fault of the controller or the subcontractor is likely to have an impact on the concrete assessment of the damages to be paid in compensation for the moral damage suffered.

89       Taking into account this response from the referring court, it is appropriate to understand the fifth question as seeking, in essence, to know, on the one hand, whether Article 82 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the The liability of the data controller is subject to the existence of a fault committed by the controller and, on the other hand, whether the degree of seriousness of this fault must be taken into account when setting the amount. damages awarded in compensation for moral harm on the basis of this provision.

90       With regard to the first part of this question, it should be noted that, as recalled in paragraph 82 of this judgment, Article 82(1) of the GDPR makes the right to compensation subject to the meeting of three elements, namely the existence of a violation of this regulation, the existence of damage suffered as well as the existence of a causal link between this violation and this damage.

91       Article 82(2) of the GDPR provides that any controller having participated in the processing is liable for damage caused by the processing which constitutes a violation of this regulation. However, the wording of this provision in certain of its linguistic versions, in particular the German version which is that of the language of proceedings in the present case, does not make it possible to determine with certainty whether the violation in question must be attributable to the controller so that its liability can be engaged.

92       In this regard, it appears from an analysis of the different linguistic versions of the first sentence of Article 82(2) of the GDPR that the controller is presumed to have participated in the processing constituting the violation of that regulation which is referred to . Indeed, while the German, French or Finnish language versions are formulated in an open manner, a number of other language versions turn out to be more precise and use a demonstrative determiner for the third occurrence of the term "treatment", or for the third reference to this term, so that it is clear that this third occurrence or reference refers to the same operation as the second occurrence of this term. This is the case for the versions in Spanish, Estonian, Greek, Italian or Romanian.

93       Article 82, paragraph 3, of the GDPR clarifies, in this perspective, that a data controller is exempt from liability, under paragraph 2 of this article 82, if he proves that the fact which caused the The damage is in no way attributable to him.

> 94       It thus emerges from a combined analysis of these different provisions of Article 82 of the GDPR that this article provides for a **regime of liability for fault in which the burden of proof rests not on the person who has suffered damage, but on the data controller**.

95       Such an interpretation is corroborated by the context in which this Article 82 fits as well as by the objectives pursued by the Union legislator through the GDPR.

96       In this regard, first, it is apparent from the wording of Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR that those provisions are limited to requiring the controller to adopt technical and organizational measures intended to avoid, as far as possible, any violation of personal data. The appropriateness of such measures must be assessed in a concrete manner, by examining whether these measures have been implemented by the controller taking into account the various criteria referred to in those articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent to the processing concerned as well as than the risks induced by the latter (see, to this effect, judgment of 14 December 2023, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite , C‑340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph 30).

97       However, such an obligation would be called into question if the data controller was subsequently required to repair any damage caused by processing carried out in violation of the GDPR.

> 98       Secondly, with regard to the objectives of the GDPR, it is apparent from recitals 4 to 8 of that regulation that it aims to achieve a balance between the interests of those responsible for the processing of personal data and the rights of persons whose such data is processed. The aim is to enable the development of the digital economy, while guaranteeing a high level of personal protection. It is thus a balancing of the interests of the data controller and the people whose personal data is processed, which is intended. However, a **liability mechanism for fault accompanied by a reversal of the burden of proof, as provided for in Article 82 of the GDPR, makes it possible to precisely ensure such a balance**.

99       On the one hand, as the Advocate General observed, in substance, in point 93 of his Opinion, it would not be consistent with the objective of such high protection to opt for an interpretation according to which data subjects who have suffered damage as a result of a violation of the GDPR should, in the context of an action for compensation based on Article 82 thereof, bear the burden of proving not only the existence of this violation and the damage that resulted from it for them, but also the existence of a fault committed by the controller deliberately or through negligence, or even the degree of seriousness of this fault, even though said article 82 does not formulate any such requirements (see, by analogy, judgment of 14 December 2023, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite , C‑340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph 56).

100     On the other hand, a strict liability regime would not ensure the achievement of the objective of legal certainty which is sought by the legislator, as is apparent from recital 7 of the GDPR.

101     With regard to the second part of the fifth question, relating to the determination of the amount of damages possibly due under Article 82 of the GDPR, it should be recalled that, as was highlighted in point 83 of this judgment, for the purposes of assessing these damages, national judges must apply the internal rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness are respected of Union law, as defined by the settled case-law of the Court.

102     It is important to clarify that, having regard to its compensatory function, Article 82 of the GDPR does not require that the degree of seriousness of the violation of this regulation, which the controller is presumed to have committed, be taken into account when of the fixing of the amount of damages awarded as compensation for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of that provision, but requires that this amount be fixed in such a way as to fully compensate for the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of that regulation, as well as this is apparent from paragraphs 84 and 87 of this judgment.

103     Consequently, the answer to the fifth question must be that Article 82 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, on the one hand, the liability of the controller is subject to the existence of a fault committed by the latter, which is presumed unless the latter proves that the fact which caused the damage is in no way attributable to him, and, moreover, this article 82 does not require that the degree of seriousness of this fault be taken into account when setting the amount of damages awarded in compensation for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of this provision.

# On the costs

104     Since the procedure takes, with regard to the parties to the main proceedings, the character of an incident raised before the referring court, it is for that court to rule on costs. Costs incurred for submitting observations to the Court, other than those of the said parties, cannot be reimbursed.

For these reasons, the Court (Third Chamber) rules:

1)       Article 9(2)(h) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data personal character and the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation),

must be interpreted in the sense that:

the exception provided for in this provision is applicable to situations in which a medical control body processes data concerning the health of one of its employees in the capacity not of employer, but of medical service, in order to assess the capacity of that employee, provided that the processing concerned satisfies the conditions and guarantees expressly imposed by this point (h) and by paragraph 3 of said Article 9.

2)       Article 9(3) of Regulation 2016/679

must be interpreted in the sense that:

the controller of data processing concerning health, based on Article 9(2)(h) of this regulation, is not required, under these provisions, to guarantee that no colleague of the the person concerned cannot access data relating to their state of health . However, such an obligation may be imposed on the controller of such processing either by virtue of regulations adopted by a Member State on the basis of Article 9(4) of that regulation, or by virtue of the principles of integrity and confidentiality set out in Article 5(1)(f) of the same regulation and concretized in Article 32(1)(a) and (b) thereof.

3)       Article 9(2)(h) and Article 6(1) of Regulation 2016/679

must be interpreted in the sense that:

processing of data concerning health based on this first provision must, in order to be lawful, not only comply with the requirements arising therefrom , but also fulfill at least one of the conditions of lawfulness set out in this Article 6, paragraph 1.

4)       Article 82(1) of Regulation 2016/679

must be interpreted in the sense that:

the right to compensation provided for in that provision fulfills a compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on that provision must make it possible to fully compensate for the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of that regulation, and not a dissuasive or punitive function.

5)       Article 82 of Regulation 2016/679

must be interpreted in the sense that:

on the one hand, the liability of the data controller is subject to the existence of a fault committed by him , which is presumed unless the latter proves that the fact which caused the damage does not affect him. is in no way attributable, and, moreover, this article 82 does not require that the degree of seriousness of this fault be taken into account when fixing the amount of damages awarded in compensation for moral damage on the basis of this provision.
