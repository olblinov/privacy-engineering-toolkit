# Week 17-23 April 23

- **Irish DPC guidance on RoPA** (https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/records-of-processing-article-30-guidance): The guidance provides examples of how to complete the RoPA responses, including the suggested level of granularity ("payroll management" as a description of a purpose of processing). Here are some recommendations as to RoPA maintenance:
  - RoPAs should be clearly broken down and detailed according to the different business units or functions within an organisation;
  - retention periods are likely to differ depending on the category of data in question and the RoPA should reflect the retention period for each specific category;
  - add additional information such as Article 6 legal basis for processing;
  - in response to security measures, it is unsufficient to say ‘measures are in place that ensure appropriate security’ or ‘appropriate security’;
  - examples of a well completed RoPA are also provided in appendix.

- **EDPB Right to data access guideline finalized** (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-04/edpb_guidelines_202201_data_subject_rights_access_v2_en.pdf): For god's sake, EDPB, please provide a red-line version so I don't have to read the entire document again! Judging from the comparison provided in LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7054244455012290560/), the changes aim to make the right even wider, now explicitly requiring the controller to provide not only a copy, but also "all information necessary to enable the data subject to understand and verify the lawfulness of the processing". The EDPB also included Example 5. It says that from an employee's generally formulated request it is unclear which type of data the employee wants. "Without request for specification, the employee would receive a large quantity of information, without having an interest in most of the data". However, no consequence is forumulated based on that fact pattern. As a result, there is still no balancing test in the EDPB guidance between a person's right and the efforts of the controller. 

- **DPO Questionnaire sent out as part of EDPB taskforce effort published** (https://www.datatilsynet.dk/Media/638173309597630615/DPO_sp%C3%B8rgeskema.pdf): The questionnaire contains 40 questions with multiple choice answers regarding the appointment, role and responsibilities of the DPO in organizations. For example, the DPO is expected to respond in which percent of cases the DPO is involved in handling data protection issues.

- **US Online Privacy Act reintroduced into Congress** (https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/silicon-valley-congresswomen-reintroduce-comprehensive-privacy-legislation): Another attempt at introducing a federal-level bill to guarantee people's privacy, uncluding user rights, minimizing scope of data collected and used in discriminatory ways, requiring consent to be collected in plain language. Federal privacy legislation has been historically unsuccessful (https://www.axios.com/2022/09/01/pelosi-rejects-bipartisan-privacy-bill), but let's see where it goes.

- **£130k fine for 107M spam emails** (https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/04/online-recruitment-firm-fined-130-000-for-sending-107-million-spam-emails-targeting-jobseekers/): The UK regulator adopted a rather mild fine to a marketing company which sent about 244 spam emails to 437k recipients who did not provide their consent.

- **EUR 150k fine for unsecure authentication by phone in an NL bank** (https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/boetebesluit_sociale_verzekeringsbank.pdf): The bank had an outdated and incomplete set of security measures for authentication via phone. This lead to a client's family member gaining access to information of the client without such client's permission. A leak of data of even one person triggers Art. 32 liability. A very similar fact pattern triggered a EUR 30k fine in Greece (https://www.dpa.gr/sites/default/files/2023-03/4_2023%20anonym.pdf).

- **Motana joins other states in consumer privacy bill introduction** (http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0210w%24BSIV.ActionQuery?P_BILL_DFT_NO5=LC1086&Z_ACTION=Find&P_SESS=20231)
