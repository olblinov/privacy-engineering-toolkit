# Week 10 - 16 April 23

- **EDPB resolved dispute on Chapter V in Meta case; creates a task force on ChatGPT** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-resolves-dispute-transfers-meta-and-creates-task-force-chat-gpt_en): Last year, the Irish DPC triggered the dispute resolution mechanism when other DPAs did not agree on the DPC not levying a fine on Meta in connection with Chapter V non-compliance. EDPB issued a binding decision, which the DPC is obliged to adopt EDPB's decision within 1 month from now. Wonder if Meta will be prohibited from working in the EU before the DPF comes into effect. Additionally, a ChatGPT task force was established on the EU level.

- **The EU Parlaiment Civil Liberties Committee adopted resolution against EU-US Data Privacy Framework** (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230411IPR79501/meps-against-greenlighting-data-transfers-with-the-u-s-under-current-rules): The parlaiment members argue that the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an improvement on previous frameworks, but does not provide for sufficient safeguards. The framework still allows for bulk collection of personal data in certain cases, does not make bulk data collection subject to independent prior authorisation, and does not provide for clear rules on data retention. The Data Privacy Framework creates a Data Protection Review Court (“DPRC”) aimed at providing redress to EU data subjects, but its decisions would be secret, violating citizens’ right to access and rectify data about them. Moreover, DPRC judges could be dismissed by the U.S. President, who could also overrule its decisions, so the Review Court is not truly independent.

- **Washington waiting for Governor to enact My Health My Data Act** (https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=1155&year=2023#billhistorytitle): The bill has cleared both houses and is waiting for Governor's signature. The law focuses on consumer rights and rules on engagement in collection and processing of health data. According to some experts, it is meant to broaden the scope to data and uses that were not covered by HIPAA, but also touched upon sensitive data. 

- **North Carolina and Indiana join states with looming consumer privacy legislation** (https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/s525, https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/senate/5#document-6a5e0070)

- **Data brokers facing potential restrictions under newly introduced CA bill**(https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362): A bill introduced to the CA Senata seeks to require data brokers to register with, pay a registration fee to, and provide information to the California Privacy Protection Agency and introduce a data deletion mechanism. The law may take effect in 2025.

- **US Department of Health and Human Services seeks to amend HIPAA** (https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/12/hhs-proposes-measures-bolster-patient-provider-confidentiality-around-reproductive-health-care.html): In connection with Roe V. Wade, the HHS proposes to extend additional privacy protections for providers, insurers, patients and others to safeguard PHI when that information otherwise would be disclosed or used to identify, investigate, sue, or prosecute someone for seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating lawful reproductive health care.
