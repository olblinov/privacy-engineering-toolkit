# Week 3 - 9 April 2023

- **ChatGPT's world regulatory tour**:
  - European Consumer Organisation asks DPAs to launch an investigation into ChatGPT (https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/investigation-eu-authorities-needed-chatgpt-technology) citing risk of deception & manipulation.
  - US Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy sent a complaint to the FTC re OpanAI (https://www.caidp.org/app/download/8450269463/CAIDP-FTC-Complaint-OpenAI-GPT-033023.pdf?t=1680174598%C2%A0), saying that it is biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety; it's outputs cannot be proven or replicated and no independent assessment was undertaken prior to deployment.
  - Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner warns users against submitting personal data to ChatGPT and that it is in cooperation with the Italian DPA on this matter (https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/de/home/aktuell/aktuell_news.html#238887506)
  - Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada opens investigation into ChatGPT (https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2023/an_230404/)
  - OpenAI meets with Italian Garante and provides commitments on measures to address DPA's concerns (https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9872832)
  - UK National Cyber Security Centre highlights risk stemming from unfiltered open-internet text scraping used to train LLMs and resulting inaccuracies, biases etc. (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/chatgpt-and-large-language-models-whats-the-risk)

- **ICO fines TikTok EUR 14,2M due to failure to protect children's privacy** (https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/04/ico-fines-tiktok-127-million-for-misusing-children-s-data/): The ICO estimated the N of <13 children using TT at about 1,4M. In ICO's opinion, TT failed to carry out adequate checks to identify and remove underage children from its platform. As a guide on how this could be avoided, the ICO pointed to its Childrenâ€™s code to help protect children in the digital world (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/childrens-code-hub/).
  
- **Proportionality in access request considered by Belgian DPA** (https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-40-2023.pdf): In a semi-surprising turn of events, the Belgian DPA did consider proportionality in a case when an employee working for 13 years asked to access his personal emails from a corporate inbox. The DPA sidede with the employer and said that the workload for the respondent was disproportionate as the complainant did not produce any evidence showing the presence of private emails in the mailbox, did not provide specific parameters on the basis of which targeted searches of the mailbox could be carried out etc. 

- **V2 of Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR published** (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-04/edpb_guidelines_202209_personal_data_breach_notification_v2.0_en.pdf): EDPB noticed that there was a need to clarify the notification requirements concerning personal data breaches at non-EU establishments. But calm your horses, they did not remove the obligation to notify every supervisory authority for which affected data subjects reside in their Member State. The only (visible) change is that notification is the obligation of the controller and not the representative of the controller. Lame.
