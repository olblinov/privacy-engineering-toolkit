# Week 23 - 29 January 2023

- **Do I have to keep personal data alone to prove that I comply with the data protection rules on consent?** (https://www.datatilsynet.dk/hvad-siger-reglerne/vejledning/samtykke/paavisningskrav-og-dataminimering)
The Danish DPA believes that storage of consent confirmation for more than 5 years is excessive and that the confirmation of consent shall be deleted upon consent revocation. The only exception is defense of legal claims. What is confusing to me is how the controller is supposed to protect itself if the user first accepts cookies, makes a screenshot, rejects cookies and then goes to the regulator, who in 30 days asks the controller for evidence of consent. Weird guidance, really.

- **The Norwegian SA fines Recover AS for violation of privacy** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/norwegian-sa-fines-recover-violation-privacy_en): A credit rating is the result of a compilation of personal data from many different sources and indicates the likelihood of a person being able to pay an outstanding claim. A credit rating will also include detailed information concerning the person's financial situation, such as any payment remarks, debt-to-income ratio and whether the person has any mortgages/liens. The Norwegian SA has fined Recover AS EUR 20,000 for non-compliance. The matter concerns a credit rating performed without legal basis.

- **CNIL sanctions VOODOO with 3 million euros** (https://www.cnil.fr/fr/jeux-mobiles-la-cnil-sanctionne-voodoo-hauteur-de-3-millions-deuros): the Helix Jump creator collected IDFV mobile device identifier despite user’s rejection of tracking requests in iOS. In my memory this is one of the first decisions for cookie compliance on mobile (not web) platform. I believe this signifies the change of practice and mobile apps are likely to be a target for enforcement in 2023 and 2024.

- **EDPB publishes Binding Decision concerning WhatsApp** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-publishes-binding-decision-concerning-whatsapp_en, https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/edpb_bindingdecision_202205_ie_sa_whatsapp_en.pdf): WhatsApp has been fined €5.5m by the Irish Data Protection Authority (DPA) following a binding dispute resolution decision by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The EDPB concluded that WhatsApp inappropriately relied on contracts as a legal basis for processing personal data and instructed the Irish DPA to include infringements of GDPR articles. It also asked the DPA to investigate whether WhatsApp processes special categories of personal data, data for behavioral advertising, marketing purposes, and metrics for third parties. The EDPB requested corrective measures to bring WhatsApp's data processing into compliance with GDPR within a specified timeframe.

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Concept Paper** (https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/19/CSF_2.0_Concept_Paper_01-18-23.pdf): Changes: (1) CSF 2.0 (and companion resources) will include updated and expanded guidance
on Framework implementation; (2) Add implementation examples for CSF Subcategories; (3) Develop a CSF Profile template; (4) CSF 2.0 will include a new “Govern” Function to emphasize cybersecurity risk management governance outcomes; (5) CSF 2.0 will emphasize the importance of cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM); (6) will advance understanding of cybersecurity measurement and assessment.
