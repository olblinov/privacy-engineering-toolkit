# Week 12 - 19 March 2023

- **CJEU AG: calculating loan repayment automatically is profiling** (https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-03/cp230049en.pdf): 
the question before the CJEU concerns the SCHUFA score, which is used to predict creditworthiness. In response to data access requests, SCHUFA provides only the score but not the underlying calculations & data. The AG believes that the access right reponses should also contain the logic involved; and that the right to not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing extends to SCHUFA as it indeed consitutes profiling.

- **German DPA reports on 2022 results** (https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2023/08_Taetigkeitsbericht.html?nn=251944, https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Taetigkeitsberichte/31TB_22.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4): Some metrics I was able to extract:
  - 10,658 reports of data breaches under Art. 33
  - 6,619 complaints and inquiries
  - 73 audits, 62 of those were performed on-site

- **FB pixel and business tools successfully challenged in Austria** (https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-03/Bescheid%20redacted.pdf): Similar to previous practice on GA, reliance on facebook tools was challenged in Austria. Interestingly, the DPA says that the mere possibility that the processor (fb) may be the addressee of requests from the US authorities does not make it a controller under Art. 28(10) (on processor status when it self-determines the purposes and means).

- **Irish bank fine EUR 750k for leaking 136 customer accounts** (https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/resources/law/decisions/bank-of-ireland-365-%28BOI%29-February-2023): The bank suffered 10 breaches, 6 of which related to failure of staff to follow access procedures and 4 others to access to customer X of records belonging to customer Y upon login into bank's web app.

- **ICO's privacy by design guide** (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/privacy-in-the-product-design-lifecycle/): A useful non-legalese summary of requirements towards privacy at various stages of product lifecycle, including research, design, development, launch etc. Can greatly improve your processes in conjunction with CNIL's guidance at https://github.com/LINCnil/GDPR-Developer-Guide. 

- **Taking a photo of national ID during delivery deemed excessive** (https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/reposicion-ps-00413-2021.pdf): The drivers took photos of package delivery addressees. The Spanish DPA deemed that to be unlawful and excessive. 

- **A nurse's photo with patient data in background which was seen 100 times considered a breach** (https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Dsk/DSBT_20230130_2023_0_046_014_00/DSBT_20230130_2023_0_046_014_00.html): a student took photos of the person responsible in their nursing internships and posted them on social media. From the background of the photo, the following personal data can be identified: surname, first name, number of patients, ward, date and information about nursing activities. Within 3 hours, the photo was seen ~100 times. The DPA reprimanded the hospital for failure to report the breach under Art. 33 GDPR.
