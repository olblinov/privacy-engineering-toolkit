Which companies are connected changes over time. At the time of the inspection, there were 15 affiliated companies, which fell to 8 in the spring of 2020. The processing of personal data that takes place within the scope of the collaboration is limited to the connected companies' customers in the Swedish market. The affiliated companies collect personal data from their customers and people who visit the companies' websites. The collected data is transferred to two group-wide databases, a customer database (KDB) and a behavioral database (the behavioral database). IN these databases is created profiles if individuals. The profiles are also linked to information taken from Bisnode Sverige AB.

The personal data processing as happens for the purpose adaptation of connected the company's advertisements are based on information saved in the behavioral database. The personal data processing that takes place in order to disclose personal data to affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing is based on data in KDB.

### 2.1.1	Description of the treatment of personal data as exists in the behavior database
Of the investigation in the case the following appears .

The information in the cookie can be used to track the user's browsing on the website. The data (behavioral data) as gather in when the individual surfing and since transferred to the behavior database and added to the individual's profile is:

- Task if the page view happened in logged in mode.

Bonnier News AB deletes the cookie identifier after 30 days and as of day 31 is used not longer the generated the behavioral data for adaptation of Adverts to individuals.

Tasks in the behavior database and in KDB can in certain case tied together.

When the data in the behavior database not can tied Together with tasks in KDB consists the was registered behavioral profile only of the tasks as specified above, a profile which in this decision will be called a simple behavior profile .

In cases where information in the behavior database and information in the KDB can be linked together in the behavior database is supplied tasks from KDB if purchase history sex, age, the household's car ownership and zip code, as well as statistical variables based on the individual's area of residence such as life phase, purchasing power and form of residence to the behavioral database.
These profiles comes hereafter in this decision is named supplemented behavioral profile .

The availability to affiliated companies takes place through a search tool linked to the behavioral database where the affiliated company can order a segment of customer data from theirs elected variables. One Administrator reviews if the order meets certain criteria determined within the collaboration. If this is the case, the affiliated company gets access to a code that makes it possible to target ads to users who are part of the segment.

The applies regardless of whether it is a simple or supplemented behavior profile. As for the supplemented the behavioral profile can the though contain purchase history also from other affiliated companies. In KDB sparse data after two years, which is why older data cannot be linked to the behavioral database or disclosed to affiliated companies.

### 2.1.2	Description of the treatment of personal data as exists stored in KDB
Of the investigation in the case the following appears .

The tasks if individual as exists in KDB treated in purpose to be used for affiliated companies' marketing of their own products and services through postal direct marketing and telephone sales.

In connection with an individual making a purchase or signing a subscription, the connected collects company as have one contractual relationship with the customer in tasks from he. Certain of this data is transferred to KDB. In KDB, information is linked to a profile. In KDB, the customer profile is assigned a KDB ID. If the connected company's customer is already registered in KDB, the existing customer profile is updated/supplemented with the new commitment. Otherwise, a new customer profile is created with a new KDB ID. The data which are stored in KDB and which are collected from the customer's contact with the affiliated company is name, address, phone number, social security number, email address and information linked to the customer's purchase, such as product category, brand, type of packaging (whether it is a digital or traditional item and whether it is a free or paid product). KDB also contains information on whether the customer has objected to data in KDB being used for marketing, as well as information on whether the customer has registered in the so-called NIX register. For the following categories of data there are restrictions:

- Task if email address be left not out to connected company in telephone sales and postal direct marketing.

Furthermore, information on car ownership and deceased persons is collected, as well as information on a so-called GEDI ID (which is a unique identifier in the form of a pseudonymised ID).

Data in the KDB and the behavior database can in some cases be linked together in the KDB as well. The profile then constitutes what in this decision below will be referred to as the supplemented customer database profile . This is done by a customer of an affiliated company visiting the company's website and logs in on his account at the company. The behavioral data as has been collected about the customer and which is linked to a cookie identifier can then under certain conditions be connected to the customer's KDB ID. In cases where the customer's KDB ID and the web cookie value can be connected, the KDB profile is supplemented with data collected in the last 30 days from the behavioral database. The data that are retrieved are information about which websites the customer has visited, which section of the website the customer visited (so-called content tags), and which device type the customer surfed from. Bonnier News AB has limited the type of content tags that companies other than the one whose website the individual surfed on can base their profiling on for the purposes of telephone sales and postal direct marketing. 4

When a person ceases to be a customer of an affiliated company, KDB is notified that the customer's commitment ceased and the customer flagged as passive customer. Then the customer's data in KDB is deleted after two years. Data collected from the behavioral database is deleted after 30 days. Any NIX block is always activated when contact details in KDB are made available to customers of other affiliated companies and contact details to own customers when these have been inactive for 12 months.

# 3.	Justification of the decision
## 3.1	IMY's competence

### 3.1.1	Current circumstances
Part of the personal data that is processed within the joint group collaboration has been collected by affiliated companies placing a web cookie on the visitor's computer, tablet or mobile phone. Bonnier News AB has stated that the collection is done through affiliated companies' websites. The affiliated companies then transfer this information to the behavioral database and in some cases the information is also linked with profile information in the KDB. Bonnier News AB has stated that the obligations that followed from the provisions of the Act (2003:389) on electronic communications and nowadays follows of the law (2022:482) if electronic kommunikation (LEK), meets affiliated companies and not Bonnier News AB because it is the companies that are responsible for the actual collection of the data.

### 3.1.2	Applicable regulations etc
It follows from Article 95 of the Data Protection Regulation that the Data Protection Regulation shall not entail any additional obligations for natural or legal persons who process personal data, for such areas as already covered of obligations under the so called eData Protection Directive 5 . eData Protection Directive have carried out in Swedish law through LEK, where, among other things, the collection of data through web cookies is regulated.

According to ch. 9 § 28 LEK data may be stored in or retrieved from a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment only if the subscriber or user gets access to information about the purpose of the processing and consents to it. Furthermore, it appears that this does not prevent such storage or access as is necessary to transmit an electronic message via one electronically communication network or as is necessary to provide a service that the user or subscriber expressly has requested. Before August 1, 2022, when LEK entered into force, corresponding requirements were made according to ch. 6 Section 18 of the Act on (2003:389) on electronic communications. It's Post- and the Swedish Telecom Agency (PTS), which is the supervisory authority according to LEK (chapter 1 § 5 of the regulation [2022:511] on electronic communications).

The EDPB has commented on the interaction between the eData Protection Directive and the Data Protection Regulation 6 . From the opinion, i.a. follows that the national regulatory authority which appointed according to eData Protection Directive is alone competent to monitor compliance with the directive. However, according to the data protection regulation, the supervisory authority is the competent supervisory authority for the treatment as not regulated particularly in eData Protection Directive. If only part of the processing falls under the eData Protection Directive, this does not limit the authority of the data protection authority to examine other parts of the processing according to the Data Protection Regulation. 7

This means, among other things, that the supervisory authority according to the data protection regulation is authorized to assess the legality of the personal data processing that takes place after the data retrieved from the individually terminal equipment, for example storage of obtained tasks and analysis of such tasks in purposes as pipe behavior driven online advertising. 8

### 3.1.3	IMY's assessment
The information added to the behavioral database has been collected by the affiliated companies through web cookies. The personal data processing as reviewed in this The supervisory matter is Bonnier News AB's subsequent processing of personal data in the behavioral database. That processing is not covered by the regulation in LEK or the previously valid regulation in the Act on (2003:389) on electronic communications.
The implies to the regulation in data protection regulation is applicable on the treatment and that IMY is the competent supervisory authority.

## 3.2	Bonnie News AB's personal data responsibility

### 3.2.1	Current circumstances and Bonnie News AB's attitude
It is Bonnier News AB's opinion that Bonnier News AB and the respective affiliated company have joint personal data responsibility for the processing that takes place in KDB and the behavioral database for the purposes stated above as joint. Furthermore, have Bonnier News AB stated that Bonnier News AB and affiliated companies have one in common sight on purpose and average and to Bonnie News AB have entered into so-called Joint Data Controller Agreement with the affiliated companies in accordance with Article 26.2 of the Data Protection Regulation.

Bonnier News AB has stated that each affiliated company has its own independent ("local") personal data responsibility for its own collection of data. Bonnie News AB has further stated that it has no joint personal data responsibility for the personal data processing that is carried out after the data has been disclosed to affiliated company from the common the databases. The is the connected the company who retrieved the data who is the personal data controller for the processing carried out by this company after retrieval.

### 3.2.2	Applicable regulations etc
Personal data controller is according to article 4.7 in data protection regulation the as alone or together with others determines the purposes and means for the processing of personal data. The fact that purposes and means can be determined by more than one actor means that several actors can be responsible for personal data for the same processing.

One treatment is according to article 4.2 in data protection regulation one measure or combination of actions concerning personal data or sets of personal data.

In the Fashion-ID case, the European Court of Justice found that a website owner who uses plug-ins from social networks on his website can become a joint controller of personal data with the social the network. This applies for the collection as well as the disclosure through transmission of website visitors' personal data that takes place with help of the social of the network plugins. The court pronounced also that each party is only responsible for those parts of the treatment chain for which it actually determined the purpose and means. 9

In the Wirtschaftsakademie case, the European Court of Justice stated that joint responsibility for processing does not necessarily mean that the various actors involved in the processing of personal data have the same responsibility. 10 On the contrary, these actors can be involved in various the spoon of the treatment of personal data in various degree, and where and one's level of responsibility must be assessed taking into account all relevant circumstances in the individual case.

### 3.2.3	IMY's assessment
Bonnie News AB provides two databases, KDB and the behavior database, where information from affiliated companies is combined into profiles of individuals. Under the conditions determined by Bonnier News AB and the companies, the information is made available to Bonnier News AB and the respective affiliated company.

IMY states to, beyond set the databases to the connected the companies' disposal, has Bonnie News AB together with the companies sat up the frames for the treatment differently.

IMY therefore makes the assessment that Bonnier News AB is jointly responsible for personal data with the affiliated companies for the part of the personal data processing that takes place for the common purposes of making personal data available, through profiling of individuals' information, to affiliated companies in order to display customized advertisements and for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing. This includes the collection of data for the databases, the storage in the databases and the profiling, obtaining additional data from Bisnode Sweden AB, the interconnection as happens between the behavior database and KDB and the transfer of data between the databases. Furthermore, Bonnier News AB is jointly responsible for personal data with the affiliated companies for the measures that take place before and in the event of disclosure to an affiliated company.

## 3.3	Which tasks constitutes personal data?

### 3.3.1	Current circumstances and Bonnie News AB's attitude
Under the section "Description of the group-wide personal data processing" it appears that a large amount of data collected from individuals is processed in the KDB and the common behavior database. Bonnier News AB considers that what is referred to in this decision as a completed behavioral profile constitutes personal data. However, information constitutes in the behavior database – which cannot be linked with tasks in KDB – according to Bonnie News AB anonymous behavioral data. This because the not can be connected to one person neither via KDB ID, customer ID, IP address or any other identifier of a person. Bonnier News AB thus considers that the behavioral profiles referred to in this decision as simple behavioral profiles do not constitute personal data. The segmentation as is done on these simple profiles is, according to Bonnier News AB, based only on the affiliated company's own collected information in the behavioral database (a company can, for example, choose that sports-related content and advertisements should be adapted to the data registered via a web cookie during the last the 30 days).

### 3.3.2	Applicable regulations and Other general starting points
According to Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, a personal data is any information that relates to one identified or identifiable physical person (ie the registered). Of the same provision states that an identifiable natural person is a person who directly or indirectly identifiable in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, one location data or online identifiers or one or several factors specific to the natural person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity.

According to recital 26 of the data protection regulation, the principles of data protection should apply to all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data that has been pseudonymised and that could be attributed to a natural person through the use of supplementary data should be considered as data about an identifiable natural person person. For to determine if one physical person is identifiable should MAN consider all aids, such as thinning, which, either by the personal data controller or by another person, can reasonably be used to directly or indirectly identify the natural person. To determine whether aids with reasonable probability can come to be used for to identify the physical the person should all objective factors, such as costs and time required for identification, must be taken into account, taking into account both the technology available at the time of the treatment and the technological development. According to recital 26, the principles for data protection should not apply to anonymous information that does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, or to personal data that has been anonymized in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable. The regulation therefore does not affect the processing of such anonymous information, which includes information for statistical or research purposes.

According to Recital 30 of the Data Protection Regulation, natural persons can be linked to network identifiers provided by their equipment, applications, tools and protocols, e.g. IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers, such as radio frequency tags. This can leave behind track as, particularly in combination with unique identifier and Other data received by the servers can be used to create profiles of natural persons and identify them.

From an opinion of the Article 29 group 11 , which contains an analysis of the concept of personal data, it appears that a natural person in a group is considered "identified" when he or she can in some way be "distinguished" from other persons. 12 The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has stated in its guidelines on targeted advertising in social media to also people as uses one social media service without to have created an account or a profile with the social media service can be registered in the sense referred to in Article 4.1 of the data protection regulation if the person is directly or indirectly identified or identifiable. 13 The EDPB has referred to the concept of "thinning" in reason 26 to data protection regulation and to the above mentioned the opinion from the Article 29 group.

IN Article of the 29 group opinion current behaviorally based advertising on internet further develops what it means to be identifiable:

The Article 29 Group notes that behavioral advertising often leads to the processing of personal data. Behavioral advertising normally involves the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers (through the cookie). The use of such functions with one unique identifier make the possible to track users of a particular computer even if dynamic IP addresses are used. In other words, such functions make it possible to "point out" individual data subjects, also if their name not is known. In addition relates the information collected in behavioral advertising to (that is, about) a person's characteristics or behavior and used to influence that specific person. This approach is further strengthened if one considers the possibility that profiles can be linked at any time to directly identifiable information provided by the data subject, for example information entered during registration on a website. Other scenarios that can lead to identifiability are mergers, data loss and the growing availability on the Internet of personal data linked to IP addresses. 14

### 3.3.3	IMY's assessment
IMY initially notes that the supplemented behavioral profiles (i.e. behavioral profiles linked to the KDB) contain information relating to identified or identifiable physical people. The supplementary the behavioral profiles is thus personal data.

When the applies the simple the behavioral profiles (ie behavioral profiles without coupling to KDB) IMY makes the following assessment.

In order for a task to be qualified as personal data, it is first required that the task refers to a natural person. This requirement is met for simple behavior profiles since the data describes how the individual surfing with one number of different parameters.

Furthermore, it is required that the natural person is identified or identifiable. From article 4.1 of the data protection regulation appears to the is enough to one person can is identified indirectly. The provision further states that identification can take place with reference to an online identifier. Recital 30 of the regulation lists cookies ("cookie identifiers" in the English language version) as an example of online identifiers. Identification in the sense referred to in Article 4.1 can thus take place with the help of such unique web cookie values that are used in the behavioral database.

IMY further states that it is clear from recital 26 of the data protection regulation that thinning is a way of identifying a person. This means that a person can be identified by being distinguished from other people. 15 It is therefore not required that the person be singled out by name or social security number. Such distinguishing or thinning happens when the information as treated make to the is possible to point out, draw conclusions about or take specific actions in relation to a user.
In the behavioral database, the information is linked with a unique identifier, a unique cookie value, which is linked to a specific browser or app, which in turn is linked to a device such as a computer or phone. One of the purposes of the processing of the data is to, on the basis of the user's behavior, direct marketing to a user based on that particular user's previous behavior in an identified browser or app. The purpose of the treatment is thus to draw conclusions about the individual by creating a profile and based on this to influence the individual. IMY states thus to also the simple behavioral profiles as not be connected Together with KDB means that individuals are identifiable.

IMY make against this one background the assessment to the simple the behavioral profiles constitute personal data.

## 3.4	The treatment constitutes profiling

### 3.4.1	Applicable regulations
Profiling is defined in Article 4.4 of the Data Protection Regulation as any form of automatic treatment of personal data as consists of in to personal data is used to assess certain personal characteristics of a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict this natural person's work performance, financial situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, whereabouts or transfers.

### 3.4.2	IMY's assessment
IMY notes that both the processing of personal data based on simple behavioral profiles and supplemented behavioral profiles that takes place for the purpose of making the data available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements includes profiling of data subjects as defined in Article 4.4 of the Data Protection Regulation. This is because it is a matter of automatic processing of personal data as aims to to categorize the was registered from their past behavior patterns which in its lucky make the possible to assess certain of their personal characteristics.

IMY further notes that the processing of personal data that takes place for the purpose of making contact information available for telephone sales and postal direct marketing includes profiling of registered persons as defined in Article 4.4 of the Data Protection Regulation. This is because it is a matter of automatic processing of personal data in purpose to categorize the was registered from their purchase history and in some cases also behavioral patterns.

## 3.5	Legal basic for treatment in purpose to show customized ads based on data in the behavioral database

### 3.5.1	Current circumstances and Bonnie News AB's attitude
Bonnier News AB has stated that it has coordinated its activities within the group to achieve a better data basis and make it possible to process the customers' and users' personal data for specified purposes in a cost-effective and privacy-friendly manner. Bonnier News AB uses its profiling of individuals to make information available to affiliated companies with the aim of showing customized advertisements partly on collected behavioral data that cannot be linked to KDB, partly on behavioral data where such coupling can be done and where further personal data added the registrant's profile. Bonnier News AB supports its processing to make information available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements on the legal basis in Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation.

*Legitimate interest*

Bonnie News AB have stated the following.

The company has a legitimate interest that consists in a need to understand the wishes and needs of its customers and users in order to achieve relevance in content and advertising directed at customers and users and thereby be able to offer competitive products/services and attractive advertising spaces. Many of the affiliated companies devotes one also at journalistic Operation. Publicists' business model of today consists of revenue streams from readership and advertising revenue. Group-wide personal data processing is important for the financing of the companies journalistic Operation. Bonnie News AB have also pointed on the protection for media freedom and diversity in Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

*Necessary treatment*

Bonnie News AB have stated to the treatment of personal data is necessary for to achieve the purposes of making individuals' profiles available to affiliated companies in order to display customized Adverts. The company have together with the Other the companies taken measures to minimize the number of data collected and limited how long this data is processed and seen to to the databases held separated and to only certain data is transferred between them.

*Balance of interests*

Bonnie News AB have stated the following.

Bonnie News AB's interest weighs heavier than the individually interest of protection for their personal data.

Processing of personal data to display customized ads based on the individual profile is one basic requirement for to journalists and publicists will be able to get income and, by extension, be able to conduct journalism.

The exists ability to object against profiling based on behavioral data. According to the information that individuals receive in Bonnier News AB's personal data policy, the individual can object to information about their online behavior being processed in the common customer database. 16 This means that the link between the individual's customer data and their surfing behavior is removed.

Those registered have a direct relationship with one or more affiliated companies. The users/customers have either visited an affiliated company's website, purchased products from an affiliated company or an active digital subscription. Many of the customers are subscribers who have a long-term relationship with the company that provides the service or product and can therefore be considered to have a greater expectation that their data will be processed. Many readers have a strong commitment to their preference for news media. IN certain extent hear customer profiles in KDB to unit purchase such as literature, newspaper and merchandise purchases. In these cases, the relationship between customer and supplier may be considered be something less unique. Further is the interaction voluntary, clear information is left and there are alternative products such as physical newspapers that you can read completely anonymously.

The treatment have likely not any negative impact on the was registered interest. Individuals interacting with affiliated companies is voluntary and it is in their interest that the companies' services is so relevant as possible. Further have Bonnie News AB referred to the Article 29 Group finding that targeted marketing based on simple customer profiles, such as gender, age, place of residence and broad interests (eg "fashion") typically has no significant impact on individuals. Bonnier News AB has further taken actions for to ensure to one minimum of tasks treated in relation to the purposes and to reduce integrity risks in general. Among other things, the personal data is not shared with companies other than the affiliated companies within the group and every these company is subordinates of the Bonnier Group framework for personal data processing. 17

The current processing is within the data subjects' reasonable expectations due to the fact that the individuals who come into contact with the companies do so of their own free will with the aim of accessing content on websites, purchasing services and/or products and that they always have a customer- /user relationship with one or more companies in the group. The companies' personal data policies contain clear information about how customers' and users' personal data is processed and shared within the group. The processing carried out within the framework of KDB and the behavioral database is closely associated with the companies' services and products which should have meaning for the consumer's expectations. To many of the companies' products and services are online and in many cases free or ad-financed should lead to a special expectation and acceptance of certain personal data processing for e.g. customization of content and advertising. Today, even many digital products that are consumed by a very large part of consumers in society are adapted to the individual and it is Bonnier News AB's opinion that today's consumers expect that the digital products and services they consume will be adapted to a certain extent according to the individual.

### 3.5.2	Applicable regulations etc
Personal data will treated on one legally, correctly and open way in relationship to the data subject, according to Article 5.1 ai of the data protection regulation. That the data must be processed legally means, among other things, that at least one of the conditions specified in Article 6.1 is met.

Consent is, according to Article 6.1 a, one of the legal bases on which a personal data controller can support its processing of personal data. Another legal basis is legitimate interest according to Article 6.1 f , which requires that three cumulative conditions are met. There must be (i) a legitimate interest of the personal data controller or of a third party to whom the data is disclosed, (ii) the processing of personal data will be necessary for the entitled interest which is pursued and (iii) the data subject's interest in the protection of his personal data must not outweigh. 18

Recital 47 of the data protection regulation states that a legitimate interest may exist, for example, when there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the data controller, for example if the data subject is a customer of the data controller. It is stated that the processing of personal data for direct marketing can be considered a legitimate interest. Furthermore, it is stated that a legitimate interest requires a careful assessment, which includes whether the data subject at the time and in connection with the collection of personal data can reasonably expect that processing for the stated purpose may take place. In particular, the data subject's interests and fundamental rights could weigh more heavily if personal data treated during circumstances where the registered cannot reasonably expect any further treatment.

According to ch. 9 Section 28 LEK, which implements Article 5.3 of the eData Protection Directive in Swedish law, may tasks is stored in or be picked up from user's or of subscribers terminal equipment only if the subscriber or user receives access to information about the purpose with the treatment and consent to it. This does not prevent such storage or access which is needed to transmit an electronic message via an electronic communication network or which is necessary to provide a service to the user or the subscriber expressly have requested. Corresponding requirement applied previously according to ch. 6 § 18 of the Act (2003:389) on electronic communications.

From the EDPB's guidelines on connected vehicles, it appears that data collected on the basis of consent in accordance with Article 5.3 of the eData Protection Directive or covered by the exceptions in Article 5.3 of that directive can only be further processed for another purpose, if the controller requests further consent or is supported by Union law or the legislation of a Member State. 19 The EDPB further states that such further processing cannot rely on a compatibility test under Article 6(4) of the Data Protection Regulation as it would undermine the protection of the eData Protection Directive. Further pronounces EDPB to one consent must, when so is required according to the eData Protection Directive, be specific and informed, which means that the data subjects must be aware of each processing purpose and have the right to refuse specific purposes. About further processing on the basis of a compatibility test according to Article 6.4 of the Data Protection Regulation would be Possible would themselves the principle for the consent requirements of the current directive are circumvented. 20

In the EDPB guidelines on targeted advertising in social media, personal data is divided into the categories of data that the data subject actively and knowingly provided to the data controller, observed data that the data subject provided through the use of the service or device, and derived and inferred data created on basis of the tasks as the registered provided. 21 According to EDPB there are two legal grounds that may come into question for processing such data that the data subject actively and knowingly provided, namely consent according to 6.1 a and legitimate interest according to 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation. Regarding data collected through observed data provided by the data subject through the use of a service or device, including that collected through cookies, the EDPB states that Article 6(1)(f) cannot constitute a legal basis for such targeted advertising where individuals are tracked on several different websites and locations. 22 Furthermore, the EDPB states that for such processing, consent is probably the most appropriate legal basis in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. In the assessment, one must move on take into account that the processing includes activities for which the legislator in the EU has wanted to provide additional protection. 23

The EDPB has stated in its guidelines on consent that if the data controllers choose to invoke consent for any part of the processing, they must be prepared to respect this choice and stop this part of the processing if an individual withdraws their consent. It would be fundamentally unfair to the data subjects to give the message that the data will be processed based on consent while actually referring to another legal basis. In other words, the personal data controller may not change the legal basis from consent to other legal grounds. The EDPB further states that, for example, retroactive use of legitimate interest is not permitted as basic for to motivate the treatment, if the have arose problem with to obtain valid consent. Due to the requirement that the data controllers must state legal basic when the personal data is obtained, must the have Certainly which the legal basis is before they collect the data. 24

In an opinion from the Article 29 group on the concept of legitimate interest in Directive 95/46/EC, it appears that when carrying out the balancing of interests, consideration should be given to the type of interest that is stated, the damage the data controller would suffer if the data were not processed, the nature of the information, how the personal data is processed, the position of the data subject and the person in charge of personal data position, the was registered reasonable expectations on What what will happen to their data and the consequences for the data subjects. If, after analyzing the above factors, it is still unclear how this trade-off occurs can the design of so-called further protective measures be decisive for the outcome of the balance of interests. 25

In the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling given guidance when profiling can support one on justified interests according to 6.1 f. According to the guidelines is following factors relevant:

- How detailed the profile is.
- How Extensive the profile is.
- The profiling consequences.
- The protective measures as is intended to ensure one equitable, non-discriminatory and accurate profiling process.

Article 29 group have in several opinions repeatedly his taking a stand to the is difficult to rely on Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation for such profiling that takes place for marketing or advertising purposes when individuals are tracked on several different websites, locations, devices, services or for data brokerage activities. 26

### 3.5.3	Starting points for IMY's assessment
Bonnier News AB supports its processing of personal data for the purpose of making it available individual's profiles to connected company in purpose to show customized advertisements on the legal basis of legitimate interest according to article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation. Before IMY trying if the legal the foundation can constitute basis for Bonnier News AB's treatment finds IMY reason to go into how the processing relates to certain statements made in the EDPB guidelines.

From the EDPB's guidelines on targeted advertising in social media, it appears that when it comes to information that the data subject has actively and knowingly provided, both consent and legitimate interest can form a legal basis for the processing. However, it is clear from the guidelines that for data collected through observation (eg by cookies) can justified interest not work as one suitable legal basis when the targeted advertising is based on tracking individuals across multiple websites and locations.

IMY notes to Bonnie News AB collects in data to its behavior database from several different websites but an affiliated company can only retrieve information based on behavioral data collected from the company's own digital services. This applies regardless of whether it is a simple or supplemented behavior profile.

The EDPB's guidelines on connected vehicles state that data collected on the basis of consent according to 5.3 of the eData Protection Directive can only be further processed for one Other purpose if the personal data controller requests further consent or the processing is supported by EU law or national regulation. Also the section on interaction between consent and other legal bases in Article 6 of the EDPB guidelines on consent addresses when the data subject has been given the message that they have obtained the rights that a consent entails and the unfairness of not respecting these by referring to a other legal basis.

IMY notes to the situation in the case in certain Mon differs one from the as is described in these guidelines. IN the case is the the connected the companies as collects in the information according to
5.3 of the eData Protection Directive and which is thus covered by the requirement for consent in that provision. The connected the companies have to ensure to the have legal support for its processing according to the eData Protection Directive and the Data Protection Regulation. The affiliated companies' processing of personal data is not covered by this supervision.

It is thus not Bonnier News AB that collects the data with the support of consent in accordance with the national regulations implementing Article 5.3 of the eData Protection Directive. The is first when the connected the companies for in the personal data in the behavior database and KDB as Bonnier News AB's processing begins. Bonnier News AB thus does not change the legal basis from consent to legitimate interest.

IMY notes at the same time that Bonnier News AB is part of the same group as the affiliated companies and that Bonnier News AB is jointly responsible for personal data with the affiliated companies for the processing of personal data in the databases. The fact that group-wide databases have been set up should not mean that the data subjects receive worse protection compared to if the processing took place at the group company that collected the personal data. In other words, Bonnier News AB should not have greater opportunities to process the personal data based on the legal basis of legitimate interest than the affiliated companies have. According to IMY should therefore the above presented the guidelines have meaning for the assessment of the opportunity to use legitimate interest as a legal basis in the case.

From the above, it can be concluded that the scope, based on Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation, to further process data collected with the support of consent according to LEK is very limited. At the same time, it can be stated that in the data protection regulation there is no prohibition against using Article 6.1 f as legal basic for the current the form of treatment. IMY goes because further and examines whether the processing is supported by Article 6.1 fi of the Data Protection Ordinance. IMY's examination of whether Bonnier News AB has support for its processing in Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation is based on the three conditions that must be met according to the provision:

(i) Available the one justified interest at the personal data controller or with third parties to whom the data is disclosed?
(ii) Is the treatment of personal data necessary for the legitimate interest pursued?
(iii) Weighs the was registered interest of protection for theirs personal data heavier?

IMY treats the first two steps of the interest trade-off jointly for the supplemented and simple behavioral profiles (Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4). Then processed the third and last the step separate for the supplemented the behavioral profiles (section 3.5.5) and the simple behavioral profiles (section 3.5.6).

### 3.5.4	Justified interest
Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make information available to members company for to show customized Adverts is of commercial character. To an interest is commercially excludes not to the interest is justified without crucial for this assessment is whether the interest is legal, specific and constitutes a real and actual interest. 27

Bonnier News AB's and affiliated companies' interest is legal, real and actual. IMY therefore notes that Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles for accessibility and the connected of the companies interest to treat personal data to display customized ads based on customers' and users' customer profiles and behavioral profiles is eligible.

### 3.5.5	Is the treatment necessary for the entitled the interest?
The requirement on necessity in article 6.1 f in data protection regulation will is tried together with the principle of data minimization in Article 5.1 c. 28 The purpose of the processing is to make data available to affiliated companies in order to display customized advertisements based on individuals' profiles. In the case it has emerged that Bonnier News AB together with the affiliated companies have took steps to minimize the number collected data and limit how long these data are processed and ensure that the databases in which the data are processed are kept separate and that only certain data are transferred between them. Against this background, IMY finds that the processing described in this decision is necessary for the stated purpose.

### 3.5.6	The balancing of interests for treatment of personal data in supplemented behavioral profiles
Bonnier News AB's interest, to create profiles to make information available to connected company for to show customized Adverts can according to the company benefit the individual either through higher income enabling free or cheaper services or that the individual meet of offers as the is interested of. Bonnie News AB have further emphasized that many of the affiliated companies engage in journalistic activities and that publishers' business model today consists of revenue streams from readership and advertising revenue and that group-wide personal data processing is important for the financing of the companies' journalistic activities. Against this background, the company has assessed that its interest weighs particularly heavily.

As IMY has already established, the interest in displaying customized advertisements is justified in the sense referred to in Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation. Regarding the question of how heavy this interest weighs, IMY states that the interest is not journalistic in itself, but of commercial nature. By the profiling is created knowledge if customers and leads that enable revenue from personalized advertising. IMY assesses that Bonnier News AB's and the connected of the companies commercial interest not weighs so heavy as Bonnier News AB claims.

When the applies the assessment of the was registered interests considers IMY the following.

As noted above, Bonnier News AB collects personal data in the behavioral database originally collected by the affiliated companies through web cookies. The consent requirement that applies according to ch. 9 § 28 GAME 29 for that collection provides strong privacy protection and an opportunity for data subjects to control the use of the collected data. This protection risks, as the EDPB stated in several of its guidelines, being undermined if the collected personal data is processed on the basis of other legal grounds, such as, for example, legitimate interest according to Article 6.1 f of the Data Protection Regulation. As IMY has already stated, Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invoke the legal basis of legitimate interest for the processing of the personal data collected by the affiliated companies using cookies. IMY therefore considers to of the data character implies to the was registered interest should be assessed great weight in the balancing of interests.

Furthermore, IMY assesses that the scope for using Article 6.1 fi the data protection regulation as the legal basis for profiling based on observed data is limited (cf EDPB's guidelines 8/2020 if directed advertising in social media p. 77–78). IMY therefore states that the nature of the processing also means that the data subjects' privacy interest weighs heavily.

Bonnie News AB have highlighted to profiling and customized Adverts can benefit the registered in that it enables higher revenues for the affiliated companies, which in turn enables them to offer free or cheaper services. It can also benefit the registrant by being met with offers that he is interested in. IMY does not dispute that the processing can to some extent benefit the registered, but believes that the overall interest of the profiling is to create as accurate advertising as possible to get customers and potential customers to buy goods or services and to receive income from such advertising.

IN the case behavioral data can be connected to KDB in purpose to show customized Adverts (the so-called supplemented behavioral profiles) IMY considers the following in its assessment.
Tasks for the profiling is admittedly not collected from different websites, which according to the EDPB's guidelines would do to article 6.1 f in data protection regulation not works as an appropriate legal basis, but profiling instead includes data collected from Other context as earlier made buy, obtained demographic information as well statistical tasks. IMY consider to the profiling is Extensive to its character and that such profiling is not something a data subject can expect without having consented to such personal data processing.

IMY consider at one weighed together assessment to the was registered privacy interest outweighs the interests of Bonnier News AB and the affiliated companies.

Against this background, IMY states that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data in battle with article 6.1 in data protection regulation in purpose to profile the registered based on their behavioral data in one so called supplemented behavioral profile and make the profiles available to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements.

### 3.5.7	Balance of interests for treatment of personal data in simple behavioral profiles
As IMY ascertained above in Episode 3.5.4 is Bonnie News AB's interest, to create profiles to make data available to affiliates to display customized ads is one commercially interest as not weighs so heavy as Bonnie News AB claims.

When the applies the assessment of the was registered interests considers IMY the following.

Bonnier News AB has taken measures to minimize the number of data collected, introduced integrity enhancing rules at the segmentation, introduced thinning rules and appointed that data collected from an affiliated company can only be used by that company. The profiling thus only takes place on a company's "own visitors". Furthermore, Bonnier News AB informs through its personal data policy about the current processing.

Against this must be weighed the fact that the collection and profiling of simple behavioral profiles enables the mapping of individuals through observed data, which entails a greater breach of privacy than when the data is collected through the active participation of the data subject. IMY considers that the data subjects' privacy interest is strong due to the nature of the data (that the collection of the data is given special protection in LEK). As IMY has already stated, Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invoke the legal basis of legitimate interest for the processing of the personal data collected by the affiliated companies using cookies. Furthermore, IMY believes that when individuals' browsing behavior is monitored to display tailored advertising, this may give the data subject the feeling of losing control over their data and the feeling that Become supervised. This can result in to individual is affected in the choice of What the takes part of on a website.

In a balanced assessment, IMY considers that the privacy interest of the data subject outweighs the interests of Bonnier News AB and affiliated companies, even in the case of processing of personal data in simple behavioral profiles on basic of to this enables profiling of individuals.

Against this background, IMY notes that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data without having a legal basis for it in accordance with Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation in order to profile the data subjects based on their behavioral data in so called simple behavioral profiles and make available the profiles to affiliated companies for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements.

## 3.6	Legal basic for treatment in purpose to make available contact details for telephone sales and postal direct marketing

### 3.6.1	Applicable regulations etc
In order to be able to rely on Article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation, as reported, above, the three the conditions as specified in the article be fulfilled. The must there is a legitimate interest of the person in charge of personal data or of a third party to whom the data is disclosed, the processing of personal data must be necessary for that entitled interest as pursued and the was registered interest of protection for their personal data must not weigh more heavily. 30

Article of the 29 group and EDPB's guidelines concerning profiling and the application of Article 6 has been explained in section 3.5.

### 3.6.2	Current circumstances and Bonnie News AB's attitude
Bonnier News AB has stated that the group has coordinated its activities in order to achieve a better data base and enable the processing of customers' and users' personal data for specified purposes in a cost-effective and privacy-friendly manner way. Bonnie News AB profiles registered in purpose to make the data available for telephone sales and post I direct marketing. The profiling which this means is based partly on information in KDB collected from affiliated companies during purchases and subscriptions (so-called customer engagement), partly on information obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB and, for a small part of the profiles, information from the behavior database. Bonnier News AB bases its processing on Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation.

*Legitimate interest*
Bonnie News AB have stated to the connected the companies have one justified interest to market their products and services in an efficient and privacy-friendly way.

*Necessary treatment*
Bonnier News AB has stated that together with the affiliated companies, they have taken measures to minimize the number of data collected, how long this data is processed and, in order to live up to the data minimization principle, kept the databases separated and only transferred certain data. Furthermore, Bonnier has News AB has taken measures so that no more information than is necessary is disclosed to the affiliated companies. When disclosing, only the data points that are defined as necessary for the marketing channel specified at the time of disclosure, i.e. telephone number in the case of a telephone sales campaign and address in the case of postal direct marketing, are provided. The data points as the segmentation based on, be left not out.

*The balancing of interests*
Bonnie News AB have stated the following.

Bonnie News AB's interest to make available tasks for connected company based on the data subject's profile to be used for telephone sales and postal direct marketing outweighs the data subject's privacy interest.

By using the group's existing resources for telephone sales and postal direct marketing, instead of buying the same information/resources from an external party, a cost saving occurs while enabling a more controlled utilization rate of addresses and phone number than What as had been possible otherwise. The treatment also aims to save on purchasing costs.

Bonnier News AB, together with the affiliated companies, has taken measures to minimize the number collected tasks, limited how long these tasks processed and with the aim of living up to the data minimization principle, held the databases separated. For the purposes of telephone sales and postal direct marketing, Bonnier News has AB limited the type of content tags generated by the registrant's surfing on Other of the company web pages. 31 One coupling between the databases have further could only be done with a small percentage of users.

Furthermore, within the framework of the collaboration, something called purpose-adapted schedules is applied. These regulate which information is released from KDB. In the disclosure, only the data points defined as necessary for the marketing channel are provided as specified at the disclosure, to example phone number at a telephone sales campaign and address at postal direct marketing. The data points on which the segmentation is based are not disclosed.

The exists one special ability for the registered to ask deletion from the common database. The registered person also has the right to object to the data being used for telephone sales and postal direct marketing.

Those registered have a direct relationship with one or more affiliated companies. The users/customers have either visited an affiliated company's website, purchased products from an affiliated company or have an active digital subscription. Many of the customers are subscribers who have a long-term relationship with the company that provides it the service or the product, and can because considered have one major anticipation that their data is processed. Many readers have a strong commitment to their preference for news media. IN certain extent hear customer profiles in KDB to unit purchase such as literature, newspaper and merchandise purchases, where the relationship between customer and supplier may be considered somewhat less unique. Furthermore, the interaction is voluntary, clear information is provided and there are alternative products such as physical newspapers that can be accessed completely anonymously.

The treatment have according to Bonnie News AB likely not one negative impact on interest of the data subject.

The processing that takes place is within the data subjects' reasonable expectations due to the fact that the individuals who come into contact with the companies do so of their own free will in order to take part in content on websites, purchase services and/or products and that they always have a customer -/user relationship with one or more group companies. Furthermore, the companies' personal data policies contain clear information about how customers' and users' personal data is processed and shared within the group. The processing carried out within the framework of the KDB/behavioral database is closely associated with the companies' services and products which should have meaning for the consumer's expectations. To one group for reasons of efficiency, coordinate systems and central functions and share certain data should not either be unexpectedly for the registered. Customers as not reported one to The NIX registry has a reasonable expectation that their contact details may be used for postal direct marketing or telephone sales. Consumers are used to this type of marketing.

The group-wide policy provides information on direct marketing and telephone sales. It states that addresses and telephone numbers can be used by the Bonnier companies for direct marketing via mail and telephone sales. It appears further to The Bonnier companies can select segment as the think is relevant for the current campaign, e.g. "men in the 40-45 age range who live in Stockholm". It also appears to The Bonnier companies always respects NIX locks and if any have objected against marketing.

### 3.6.3	IMY's assessment
IMY treats the first two steps of the interest trade-off jointly for the supplemented and simple behavioral profiles (Sections 3.6.4 and 3.6.5). Then processed the third and last the step separate for the supplemented the behavioral profiles (section 3.6.6) and the simple behavioral profiles (section 3.6.7).

### 3.6.4	Is Bonnier News AB's interest in profiling individuals for the purpose of making available tasks to connected company to be used at telephone sales and direct mail marketing eligible?
Bonnier News AB's interest in creating profiles to make the information available to connected company for to be used at telephone sales and postal direct marketing is commercial in nature. IMY assesses that the companies' interest is legal, real and actual at Bonnie News AB and the connected the companies as the data be left out to. Against this background, IMY assesses that the company's interest in creating profiles to make information available to affiliated companies for the purpose of being used in telephone sales and postal direct marketing is justified.

### 3.6.5	Is the treatment necessary for the interest to profile individual in purpose to make available information to companies for use in telephone sales and direct mail marketing?
The requirement on necessity in article 6.1 f in data protection regulation will is tried together with the principle of data minimization in Article 5. 32 The purpose of the processing is to make information available to companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing. IN the case have emerged to Bonnie News AB together with the Other the companies have taken actions for to minimize the number collected tasks and limit how long these data are processed and ensure that the databases in which the data are processed are kept separate and that only certain data are transferred between them. Furthermore, the company has ensured that no more information than is necessary is disclosed to the affiliated companies for use in telephone sales and postal direct marketing. Against this background, IMY finds that the processing is necessary for the legitimate purpose.

### 3.6.6	Balance of interests for treatment of personal data in completed customer database profiles
Bonnie News AB have highlighted to the connected the companies have one interest to to market
its products and services in an efficient and privacy-friendly way . IMY notes, however, that the interest in making data available for use in telephone and postal sales direct marketing is one commercially interest as not weighs particularly heavy.

When the applies the assessment of the was registered interests considers IMY the following.

The profiling that is done on the completed customer database profiles includes data collected from affiliated companies during purchases and subscriptions (so-called customer engagement), data obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB and data from the behavior database (including tasks as collected in of the connected the companies through cookies). IMY has already stated above that Bonnier News AB should not have a greater opportunity than the affiliated companies to invoke the legal basis of legitimate interest when processing personal data that the affiliated companies have collected with the help of cookies. The behavioral data that is retrieved from the behavioral database of a person registered with KDB is also collected from various company websites. IMY considers that those registered cannot be considered expect say that their behavioral data is collected for marketing purposes just because they visit a web page. Nor can they be considered to expect that their behavioral data are combined with tasks from one Other purchase situation or collected information from other registers for the purpose of being contacted for telephone sales or postal direct marketing. This change not of the integrity enhancing the action to the affiliated companies that carry out the marketing action do not get access to the collected behavioral data but only contact details.

From the EDPB's guidelines it appears that the scope to use legitimate interest as a legal basis for profiling depends on how detailed the profile is, how extensive the profile is, of profiling consequences and the protective measures as is intended to ensure a fair, non-discriminatory and accurate profiling process.

IMY considers that the data subjects' privacy interest is strong due to the nature of the data since the data enable survey of individual's behavior and the collection of the data is given special protection in LEK.

IMY further notes that this is the kind of profiling referred to in Article 4.4 of the data protection regulation and that the profiling is extensive as it provides an in-depth picture of the registered. The is in addition question if tasks as collected in from various web pages combined with data collected from customer engagement and statistical data from Bisnode Sverige AB. Against this background, IMY states that the nature of the processing means that the data subjects' privacy interest weighs heavily.

In a balanced assessment, IMY considers that the data subject's privacy interest outweighs Bonnier News AB's and affiliated companies' interest in the processing of personal data as is based on so called supplemented customer database profile and which takes place with the aim of making contact details available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal marketing.

Against this background, IMY states that Bonnier News AB has processed personal data without having a legal basis for it according to Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation by profiling the data subjects based on their completed customer database profiles in purpose to make available contact details to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal marketing.

### 3.6.7	Balance of interests for personal data without coupling to the behavior database
As IMY ascertained above in Episode 3.6.6 is Bonnie News AB's interest mainly a commercial interest that does not weigh particularly heavily.

With regard to the assessment of the data subjects' interests for such processing that is not connected to the behavioral database, IMY considers the following. Bonnier News AB has taken actions for to minimize the number data points both in relationship to the principles of data minimization and storage minimization by not sharing data at item level, but only at product category, brand and type of packaging.
Profiling also does not include data collected through cookies. Of the investigation has further revealed that the individual has had the opportunity to object before the treatment and to Bonnie News AB respects the was registered wishes if to avoid marketing that has been noted in national blacklists or with the personal data controller. IMY consider against the the background to the treatment is located within the framework of what individuals can reasonably expect due to the information provided and that information is only disclosed to affiliated companies within the group.
 
In a balanced assessment, IMY considers that the interests of the data subjects or fundamental rights not weighs heavier than Bonnie News AB's and the the interests of the affiliated companies for the current processing.

Against the the background notes IMY to Bonnie News AB have had support for its processing in Article 6.1 fi of the data protection regulation.

## 3.7	Choice of intervention

### 3.7.1	Applicable regulations and Other general starting points
In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective powers, among Other reprimand, order and penalty fees. The follows of article 58.2 a–ji of the data protection regulation. IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or instead of other corrective measures referred to in Article 58(2), depending on the circumstances of each individual case.

If a personal data controller or a personal data assistant, with regard to one and the same or connected data processing, intentionally or negligently violates several of the provisions of this regulation, the administrative of the penalty fee total amount not exceed the amount as is determined for the most serious violation. This is apparent from article 83.3 of the data protection regulation.

Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty charges in each individual case is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It is stated in article 83.1 in data protection regulation. IN article 83.2 specified the factors as must be taken into account in determining whether an administrative penalty fee is to be imposed and when assessing the size of the penalty fee.

The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees under the Data Protection Regulation as aims to to create one harmonized method and principles for calculating penalty fees. 33

If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to recital 148 of the data protection regulation instead for to inflict one penalty fee issue one reprimand according to Article 58.2 b.

### 3.7.2	Same or interconnected data processing
IMY has assessed in three cases above that Bonnier News AB lacked support in Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation for its treatment of personal data. IMY assesses to these treatments, which all take place in the company's databases through profiling for marketing purposes, are interconnected in the manner referred to in Article 83.3 of the Data Protection Regulation.

### 3.7.3	Penalty fee
IMY have assessed to Bonnie News AB have transgressed article 6.1 in the data protection regulation in its processing of personal data that takes place for the purpose of displaying customized advertisements and making contact information available to affiliated companies for telephone sales and postal direct marketing. IMY does not consider these to be minor violations. Bonnie News AB will because is imposed one administrative penalty fee for these violations.

IMY states that violations of Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation are covered by Article 83.5 which implies to one penalty fee on up to twenty million EUR or four percent of the global annual turnover in the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher, may be imposed.

When determining the maximum amount of a penalty fee to be imposed on a company, the definition of the term company that the EU Court of Justice uses when applying Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU must be used (see recital 150 of the Data Protection Regulation). It appears from the court's practice that this includes any entity which exercising economic Operation, regardless of the device legal form and the way for its financing as well as whether the entity in a legal sense consists of several natural or legal persons. 34

IMY assesses that the turnover of the company that must be used as a basis for calculating the administrative sanction fee that Bonnier News AB can be imposed is Bonnier News AB's parent company Albert Bonnie AB. Of obtained tasks appears to Albert Bonnier AB's annual turnover in 2021 was SEK 23,299,000,000. The highest penalty amount as can be determined in the case is four percent of this amount, the i.e. approximately SEK 931,960,000.

IMY assesses to following factors have meaning for the assessment of the seriousness of the violation .

There has been a question of profiling of individuals that took place for profit both when the profiling happened for to show customized Adverts and when the happened for to leave out contact details for telephone sales and postal marketing.

The profiling that took place in order to display customized ads has, in the cases where information in the behavior database about individuals' surfing behavior has been linked to KDB, included surfing history, purchase history and demographic and statistical tasks. The have been question of a breach that has been going on for a long time and affected a large number of registered users and covered a large amount of personal data. However, as far as has emerged, the data that is processed does not constitute such special categories of personal data as stated in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. In this decision, IMY has assessed that the profiling through supplementary behavioral profiles was extensive in nature.

Also for the profiling of personal data in KDB where there was a connection to data in the behavioral database, so-called supplemented customer database profiles, IMY has made the assessment to the profiling been Extensive to its character, since the contained data collected about the individual's surfing behavior obtained from several websites combined with data from purchases made (customer engagement) as well as data obtained from Bisnode Sverige AB. However, IMY makes the assessment that current personal data processing does not entail major consequences for the registered. This is an impact that is judged to be moderate.

IMY consider in both these case to the profiling as happened where tasks could linked in the two databases, supplementary behavioral profiles and the supplementary customer database profiles, have higher severity compared to the violation relating to the profiling that takes place in the so-called simple behavioral profiles for to show customized Adverts. IMY consider to the profiling as happens in the so the so-called simple behavior profiles to show customized ads are in and of themselves grounds for sanction, but that it has a lower degree of seriousness than the violations where a connection could be made between the different databases. The reason for this is that there is less information about the registered and about indirect personal data. However, IMY considers that even this violation includes systematic processing that has been going on for a long time and affected a large number of registered users.

The measures taken by Bonnier to limit the intrusion into the personal integrity of the data subjects, in the form of set storage deadlines, that information is not recorded at product level, to not more tasks than necessary be left out to connected company, means, according to IMY, that the seriousness of the violations is reduced to a significant extent.
The personal data has also not been disclosed outside the group. IMY has drawn attention to the fact that Bonnier News AB has consistently taken measures to reduce the breach of privacy for the registered in his group-wide cooperation. This relationship is also taken into account when assessing the seriousness of the violations.

IMY assesses against background of the above circumstances to the overall concern violations of a low degree of seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of the penalty fee should therefore be low in relation to the current maximum amount.

In addition to the assessment of the seriousness of the violation, IMY must assess whether there are any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that have significance for the sanction fee size. IMY assesses to the is missing further aggravating or mitigating circumstances, in addition to those taken into account in the assessment of the degree of seriousness above, which affect the amount of the penalty fee.

Against background of of the violation seriously, aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the high turnover in relation to the observed violations, IMY determines the administrative sanction fee for Bonnier News AB to
13 000 000 crowns. IMY assesses to this amount is effectively, proportionately and discouraging.
