# Week 10-16 July 2023
- ‚úÖüíØüîí **Positive adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework** (https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3752): The EC quickly followed up on the positive vote from EU member states and announced the adequacy decision on Monday already. The same day, the EC published a Q&A page. Similarly to how the Privacy Shield functioned, the DPF requires companies to participate in it for transfers to them to be considered adequate. As noted by Eduardo Ustaran (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eduardoustaran_your-usual-handmade-infographic-showing-the-activity-7085280178548940800-44Wg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), the alternative is to still use the SCCs (or BCRs), which will (likely) become safer now as the underlying problem with US law identified by the CJEU in Schrems II has allegedly been fixed. Though regulators may still have a knee-jerk reaction to US-bound transfers, so no guarantees there. US companies who committed to DPF will be available at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/ (currently under construction). NOYB already pledged to challenge the DPF in the CJEU. 
 
- üç™üö´üõ°Ô∏è **German DPA finds payment or cookie tracking choice to be invalid** (https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-07/11VerwarnungPurAboModellfinalgeschwrztp_Redacted.pdf, https://noyb.eu/en/pay-or-okay-tech-news-site-heisede-illegal-decides-german-dpa): In one of my earlier digest I referred to the guidance from the German Federal DPA on paid alternatives to tracking (https://datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/pm/DSK_Beschluss_Bewertung_von_Pur-Abo-Modellen_auf_Websites.pdf). As a result, the DPA for Lower Saxony found the choice to be permissible per se, but did not like the lack of choices to specific purposes. However, the ‚Ç¨ 4.95/month payment option did not trigger a protest from the DPA due to its size, despite NOYB's calculations that the price exceeded the company's earnings in connection with potential data processing 428 times.
