  - Background: 
    - The Bonnier group: 
      - (1) collected data 
        - (a) about customer purchases (**customer DB**) and 
        - (b) surfing behavior (**behavioral DB**) such URLs, country based on IP, time spent on page as well as a random UUID cookies with a 30 day expiration; as well as 
      - (2) combined with 3rd party data in order to check and supplement individuals' contact details, and for to add statistical data as life stage, purchasing power and form of accommodation (**external DB**). The external DB enriches data in the customer DB.
    - Customer DB and behavioral DB can in certain cases be tied together, in which case the latter will be supplemented by "purchase history sex, age, the household's car ownership and zip code, as well as statistical variables based on the individual's area of residence such as life phase, purchasing power and form of residence to the behavioral database". Only last 30 days of the behavioral DB can be linked to customer DB entry.
    - Data collected was available to group companies via a search tool linked to the behavioral database where the affiliated company can order a segment of customer data from theirs elected variables. One administrator reviews if the order meets certain criteria determined within the collaboration. If this is the case, the affiliated company gets access to a code that makes it possible to target ads to users who are part of the segment.
    - Data older than 2 years cannot be accesed.
    - Data was later used for postal direct marketing and phone sales. 
    - Bonnier considered only customer DB data supplemented by behavioral DB data to be personal data. It argued that behavioral DB data is not personal data if not connected to customer DB profile.
  - DPA decisions: 
    - On the matter of profiling:
      - Bonnier stated that it had a LI to "*understand the wishes and needs of its customers and users in order to achieve relevance in content and advertising directed at customers and users and thereby be able to offer competitive products/services and attractive advertising spaces.*" In other words, a financial interest was referred to, which is not argued against by the DPA. The company did not share the customer profiles outside of the group. 
      - The DPA rejected the LI basis. The DPA concluded that such processing amounts to profiling and requires consent. In doing so, the DPA confirmed the legitimacy of the purpose, the necessity and proportionality, but argued against the balancing. Namely, the DPA considered the profiling to be so extensive that it could not have been foreseen by the data subject. Additionally, the ePrivacy Regulation requires consent, which is not lifted because Bonnier processes data of its affiliated companies. 
      - Interestingly, the DPA considered that the balance was achieved in the processing for direct marketing with the use of simple customer DB records, where **not** supplemented by behavioral DB data.
      - The DPA levied a fine of EUR 1.1M. This is approx. 0.05% of the group's total turnover of ~ EUR 2B.
    -  One of the most interesting deliberations is in section 3.3 of the decision which reviews whether the surfing data is personal data. The DPA decided that the random UUID cookie links to a specific device and is therefore an "online identifier" in the sense of the personal data definition (incl. IP addresses, cookies and other identifiers, such as radio frequency tags) and GDPR recitals and thereby directly identifies an individual.

- **Model Contractual Clauses published by Convention 108 Committee** (https://www.coe.int/en/web/data-protection/-/model-contractual-clauses-for-the-transfer-of-personal-data, https://rm.coe.int/t-pd-2022-1rev10-en-final/1680abc6b4): These clauses are addressed to Convention 108 members to be transposed into national legislation and thereby allow transfers to non-108-Convention countries, similar to how the SCCs function. The clauses are obviously inspired by the latest version of the SCCs are contain the data protection principles, data subject rights and, notably, an obligation to conduct a data transfer impact assessment same as Art. 14 of the SCCs does. Wonder if and when any 108 countries will adopt these. 

- **Benetton's weak security, profiling and storage periods cost it EUR 240k** (https://www.gpdp.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9903191#1, https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9902472): The Italian DPA determined that (1) customer data was retained indefinitely; (2) access to loyalty card system was provided under one login and password for all employees across 7 countries, without device-level controls e.g. with ability to make screenshots; (3) set profiling cookies without obtaining adequate legal basis. 

- **Data scraping website fines EUR 60k** (https://www.gpdp.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9903191#2, https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9903067): trovanumeri.com published names, addresses and phone numbers scraped from public web. The owner of the website was fined for lack of legal basis for processing (i.e. consent); (2) failure to respect data subject's rights as it was made especially difficult to contact the website owner for exercising one's rights.
