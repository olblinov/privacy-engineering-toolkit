# Week 15 - 21 May 2023

- **Ireland fines Meta €1.2 billion for US-bound transfers & sets deadlines for ceasing processing** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en, https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/Data-Protection-Commission-announces-conclusion-of-inquiry-into-Meta-Ireland, https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/final_for_issue_ov_transfers_decision_12-05-23.pdf): Decision against Meta: (a) pay a €1.2B fine; (b) by 12 October 23 to stop transferring data to the US; and (c) by 12 November 23 to delete any data already stored in the US. I see the following alternative (i.e. OR) scenarios for this situation:
(1) Most disruptive scenario: Some time before 12 Oct 23, Meta will start closing ads cabinets for EU companies AND companies collecting data from people with EU IP addresses. As a result, we will lose one of our major sources of user acquisition.
(2) Meta will transfer its ads processing infrastructure to the EU and will implement a “boundary” that no EU data leaves Europe. This would be a technical solution to comply with the ruling while continuing to do business. The impact is unpredictable as the timing and effects will be dictated by Meta.
(3) Meta will successfully challenge the ruling in Irish courts and suspend the 5 month deadline. The chances of success are 50/50.
(4) Least disruptive scenario: The EU is in the middle of negotiations with the US on data transfers. An agreement between EU and US would remove the reason for this decision => lift the requirement to stop transfer to the US. Currently the negotiations are stalled. A think the chance of success of these negotiations by 12 October 23 is 50/50.

- **Ovulation tracking app Premom fined $100,000 over data sharing with AppsFlyer and Google for ads purposes** (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ovulation-tracking-app-premom-will-be-barred-sharing-health-data-advertising-under-proposed-ftc): Easy Healthcare repeatedly and deceptively promised users in its privacy policies that it would not share their health information with third parties without users’ consent. The FTC says Premom deceived users by disclosing such sensitive and identifiable health information to marketing firm AppsFlyer and Google through the integration of each company’s SDK. What's interesting is that the FTC believes that Premom’s failure to notify users about the company’s unauthorized disclosure of their unsecured individually identifiable health information to third parties violated the FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule! 

- **$350,000 settlement following 230,5k health data breach in the US** (https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/16/hhs-office-civil-rights-settles-hipaa-investigation-arkansas-business-associate-medevolve-following-unlawful-disclosure-phi-unsecured-server-350-000.html): MedEvolve provides practice management, revenue cycle management, and practice analytics software services to covered health care entities. It had an FTP server containing electronic protected health information was openly accessible to the internet.

- **CNIL Fines an online health quiz company EUR 380k for lack of consent to health data and cookie processing and for bad security practices** (https://www.cnil.fr/en/health-data-and-use-cookies-doctissimo-fined-eu380000, https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000047552103?page=1&pageSize=10&query=*&searchField=ALL&searchType=ALL&sortValue=DATE_DECISION_DESC&tab_selection=cnil&timeInterval=01%2F03%2F2021+%3E+01%2F07%2F2023&typePagination=DEFAULT): The website deposited ad cookies without consent, netting a EUR 100k fine. In addition to that, it (1) pseudonymized data after 3 years instead of anonymizing it; (2) failed to obtain consent to health processing; (3) did not enter into a JC agreement, where required; and (4) used HTTP protocol, breaching Art. 32 obligations.
