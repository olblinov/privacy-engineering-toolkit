# Weeks 14-27 August 2023

- **Ireland orders Airbnb to delete people's IDs from their systems once verification is completed** (https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/resources/law/decisions/inquiry-concerning-airbnb-ireland-june-2023): A user complained to the DPA regarding Aribnb's request to verify their identity to continue using the service. The complaint regarded issues minimization and transparency as the user was able to use the service before the request. Airbnb originally retained IDs for the duration of the account and relied on LI for the verification processing and storage. 
    - The DPC confirmed Airbnb's valid reliance on LI provided it exhausted other ways to check the identity of the person.
    - Requesting a photographic ID does not infringe upon data minimization.
    - However, what does infringe upon data minimization is storage of the photo ID after verification is complete. Hence, the DPA ordered Airbnb to remove such excess data from its systems.

- **Lack of DPA costs a Spanish company 120k** (https://www.aepd.es/documento/ps-00243-2023.pdf): An ordered package was delivered to another person instead of the intended recipient. The DPA found that there has been a relationship of sub-processing without proper documentation and fined the sub-processor. Interesting that neither controller, nor processor were fined in addition to that.
