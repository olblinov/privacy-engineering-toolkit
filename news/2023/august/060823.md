- **France confirms Google's cookie banner compliance** (https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/163946, https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000047905718?init=true&page=1&query=google&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all): Back in December 2021, France fined Google for EUR 150m for cookie banner breaches. Following that, Google added a "Only allow essential cookies" button, which CNIL confirmed as compliance with its earlier ruling. This is interesting as Google allows choice only with respect to Search customization and Ad personalization on Search, but seemingly does not offer the choice for processing to, i.e. "measure audience engagement and site statistics to understand how our services are used and enhance the quality of those services", in other words, analytics & product development. 

- **Sending documents unencrypted via email is incompliance with privacy by design and security obligations** (https://www.aepd.es/documento/ps-00331-2022.pdf): A bank customer was requested by its bank to send documents confirming origin of funds. However, the only way offered was by email; encryption and/or upload via portal were not available. The Spanish AEPD fined the bank €1.5 million in connection with Article 25 and €1 million with Article 32 GDPR.
