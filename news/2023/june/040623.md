- **EDPB Case Law Digest on Article 21 (objection) and Article 17 (data erasure)** (https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-02/one-stop-shop_case_digest_on_the_right_to_object_and_right_to_erasure_en.pdf): The objection section is not really interesting, save for a case in Estonia where the local authority considered that an objection should cover the global account instead of the single account associated with the source of objection request. In the data erasure section, there are two interesting cases about data retention following erasure based on compliance with the law & legitimate interest.

- **Good privacy practices lead UK High Court to stiking out class action law suit against Google & Deepmind** (https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Prismall-v-Google.pdf, https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b73819ba-a5df-4770-92af-02ae6656c4d2): NHS transferred certain data to Google & Deepmind to create an app to assist clinicians. A claim was brought on behalf of 1.6M people in connection with loss of control over personal data. The Court looked for a criterion for grouping the claimants within one group, i.e. lowest common denominator characteristics for the class members. The Court decided that expectation of privacy was not one of them or did not cross the de minimis threshold as data was held securely, no one person had access to it, it was already in public domain, was deleted in 12 months. The Court also found that there is no realistic prospect for the claimant to collect anything bigger than nominal damages for loss of control, if any. 

- **Bank's automated rejection of consumer application for credit card nets it EUR 300k fine** (https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/berlin-sa-imposes-300-000-euro-fine-against-bank-after-lack-transparency_en, https://www.datenschutz-berlin.de/pressemitteilung/computer-sagt-nein/): The bank rejected a credit card application without any particular justification. Hence, it was also not possible for him to meaningfully challenge the automated individual decision. The Berlin DPA found that the bank had violated Article 22(3), Article 5(1)(a) and Article 15(1)(h) GDPR in the specific case.
