# Week 12 - 18 June 2023

- **€4.98M fine against Spotify for unclear responses to access requests** (https://www.imy.se/en/news/administrative-fee-against-spotify/, https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/2023/beslut-tillsyn-spotify.pdf): In the view of the DPA, Spotify's description of processing purposes could have been clearer. Especially technical data may need to be explained in the individual's own, native language. The DPA had issues with category names such as "user data" and "usage data" as they were very generic and non-informative. A response containing the criteria for storage periods was also regarded as incomplete. It's funny to read the press release that the DPA considered the violations to be minor and the fine was only €4.98M.

- **Why couldn't a fortune telling company foresee an audit resulting in a EUR 150k fine?** (https://www.cnil.fr/en/online-clairvoyance-kg-com-fined-eur-150000): The fine includes a 30k cookie fine and a 120k GDPR fine: (1) recording all phone calls; (2) lack of consent for storing bank data for subsequent purchases; (3) lack of consent to special data processing; (4) bad security and failure to notify of breach. If I recall correctly, this is the first fine for lack of consent for saving credit cards for subsequent purchases - a risk I considered dormant due to lack of notable cases in furtherance to the EDPB Recommendations 02/2021 which excluded LI for such activities. 

- **Spain presents on online tool (in English!) stramlining RoPA, impact assessments** (https://gestiona2.aepd.es/): The tool provides for a nice repository of high-risk activities, whether based on data subject demographic, based on purposes such as profiling, types of data, effects of processing etc. I intend to use it precisely as inspiration for in-house PIAs.

- **Italy's battle against calls to people on the do-not-call register** (https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9894662, https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9893693, https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9894631): Italian DPA issued 3 fines totalling EUR 8.5M for promotional calls to people who entered in the public do-not-call register. Its funny to see regional specialisation: Italy is constantly fighting spammers, Spain is fining SIM duplication etc.
