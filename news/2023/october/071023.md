- **Norwegian Privacy Board confirms that informed consent cannot rely on disclosure in Privacy Notice** (https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/1d47020af8cb4af0984818f291d902f0/pvn-2022-22-endelig-vedtak_offentlig.pdf): Quite a while ago Norway fined Grindr, the famous LGBTQ+ dating app, for sharing data about its users with advertisers. The free version of the app shared advertising ID, location data and, most importantly, the fact that the person used the themed app, to advertisers (as opposed to the premium version). They were fined EUR 6,3M at the time. Now, the Norwegian Privacy Board confirmed the earlier ruling of the DPA. An interesting item was the question of whether consent was informed in light of the disclosures in the Privacy Notice. The Board says: "This declaration explains in detail how Grindr processes personal data, and aims to fulfill the data controller's duties according to the regulation's article 13. A privacy declaration is not a document to which consent must be given in principle. It is a document of an informative nature, and as such differs from the terms of use, to which users must agree.". Also note that the Electronic Privacy Information Center recently filed an FTC complaint against Grindr LLC for retaining and disclosing sensitive health data (https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EPIC-FTC-Grindr-Complaint.pdf). 

- **EUR 27k fine for cookies without consent** (https://www.datatilsynet.dk/afgoerelser/afgoerelser/2023/okt/texas-andreas-petersen-indstilles-til-boede): Pretty standard stuff - use of cookies without consent, sharing data with Meta & Google. Just another data point for assessing fine exposure.
