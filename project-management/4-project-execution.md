# Tracking

When tracking the progress of a project, it is important to track five key areas:

- Project schedule
- Action items/key tasks and achievements
- Progress to milestones
- Costs
- Decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks

## Tools to Track

- **GANTT charts** are used to track schedule, dependencies, and responsibilities.
- **Burn down charts** track work over time and compare projected versus actual work.
- **Roadmaps** track overall goals by quarter.

## Project Status Reports

Project status reports help track project progress. Key components of a project status report include:

1. Name
2. Date
3. Summary
4. Status
5. Milestones/Goals - Key accomplishments and what is coming up next
6. Issues
   1. Issue
   2. Impact
   3. Action
   4. Owner

# Risks and Changes

Risks -> Events -> Changes

Changes can include:

- New or changing dependencies
- Changing priorities
- Capacity and people issues
- Constraints on budget
- Scope creep
- Force majeure

# Dependencies

To track **dependencies**, you must first identify them. Dependencies can be **internal** or **external** and **mandatory** or **discretionary**. Steps:

1. Identification
2. Recording in risk register
3. Monitoring & control
4. Communication

**Response** to risks:

- Resolved
- Owned
- Accepted
- Mitigated

**Escalation** may be needed if there are:

- Delays on a milestone
- Budget overruns
- Loss of customer
- Delay in completion date

# Quality Management & Continuous Improvement

## Quality Management

What is **quality**: (1) ability to fulfil requirements; and (2) meet needs and expectations of customers.

Quality standards:

- Functionality,
- Design,
- Safety,
- Ease of use,
- Productivity, and
- Effectiveness.

There are four concepts:

- **Quality standards** set the requirements and guidelines for the project.
- **Quality planning** involves the process for determining which standards apply and how to satisfy them.
- **Quality assurance** helps prevent defects through methods such as customer surveys, user acceptance tests, and critical user journey mapping.
- **Quality control** helps to identify and correct defects.
  - Customer surveys
  - User acceptance tests (beta tests)
    - Explore edge cases
    - Document critical user journey

## Continuous Improvement

**Continuous improvement** is an ongoing effort to improve goods and services. It recognizes that when processes and systems are **created**, **implemented**, and **improved**, they need to be continuously reevaluated.

To improve a process, you must first identify, then analyze the process and implement improvements. This process leads to the development of best practices.

### Data-driven improvement frameworks

Data-driven frameworks, such as DMAIC and PDCA, can help with continuous improvement.

- **DMAIC** stands for **define**, **measure**, **analyze**, **improve**, and **control**.
- **PDCA** stands for **plan**, **do**, **check**, and **act**.

### Retrospectives

**Retrospectives** are a time for a team to reflect on a project. They encourage team building and collaboration and promote positive changes.

Steps to Conduct an Effective Retrospective:

1. **Create a Positive Experience**
   Ensure team members feel comfortable sharing feedback openly.
2. **Consider External Teams**
   Take into account interactions or dependencies with teams outside the immediate project group.
3. **Develop a Chain of Events**
   Review the timeline of the project to establish key milestones, decisions, and outcomes.
4. **Determine Lessons Learned**Reflect on the following:

   - What went well
   - What needs improvement
   - What the team got lucky with
   - Which risks materialized
5. **Determine Future Considerations**
   Identify actions, strategies, or areas of focus for future projects based on the insights gathered.

# Data-informed Decision Making

## Metrics

Metrics can be used to track the progress of a project and help evaluate project success. Different types of metrics are used to evaluate different aspects of the project.

- **Productivity metrics** track the productivity of the team and include the following:
  - Milestones
  - Tasks
  - Projections
  - Duration
- **Quality metrics** track the quality of the project and include the following:
  - Number of changes
  - Issues
  - Cost variance
- **Happiness metrics** track how satisfied the team and customers are with the project and include the following:
  - Satisfaction scores
  - Attitudes
  - Ease of use
- **Adoption and engagement metrics** track customer adoption and engagement with the product or service and include the following:
  - Clicks
  - Frequency of use
In addition to the metrics listed above, you mentioned key performance indicators (KPIs) and progress when discussing dashboards during our previous conversation.

## Data

**Data** can be classified as either **qualitative or quantitative**.

* **Qualitative data** is **descriptive** and can be observed but not measured.
* **Quantitative data** is **numerical** and can be measured.

**Data analysis** consists of six steps: 
1. Ask
2. Prepare 
3. Process 
4. Analyze 
5. Share
6. Act

## Visualisations

After you filter and analyze the data, you should choose a visual representation. Visual representations can include **dashboards, charts, and infographics.** 
- **Dashboards** typically track **KPIs, metrics, and progress.** 
- **Charts** include **burn-down charts and column charts.** 
- **Infographics** can be used to represent a one-pager.

## Presentation

Steps:
1. Define audience
   1. What would the audience like to know?
   2. Urgent concerns
   3. Which data points influence project
2. Find data for answer
3. Filter & analyze the data
4. Choose a visual representation
5. Shape the store
6. Gather feedback

When developing your presentation, there are three techniques to keep in mind: 

*   **Be precise**: Only include the essential points and design the presentation for 5 seconds.
*   **Be flexible**: Anticipate challenges. 
*   **Be memorable**: Use storytelling and visualizations.

# Teamwork

**Teamwork** is essential for project success. A **team** is a group that plans, solves problems, decides, and tracks progress for a shared objective.  **Teamwork** fosters creativity, accountability, and getting things done.

## Team Effectiveness

There are **five factors that influence team effectiveness**:

1.  **Psychological safety** is a shared belief that team members will not be punished or embarrassed for speaking up, sharing ideas, asking for help, or taking risks. 
2.  **Dependability** means that team members can rely on one another to complete tasks on time. 
3.  **Structure and clarity** mean that the team has clear expectations and roles, and everyone understands the consequences of performance. 
4.  **Meaning** refers to a shared sense of purpose.
5.  **Impact** refers to whether the results the team achieves make a difference. 

## Leadership Qualities & Influencing

**Leaders** play a key role in creating the conditions for teamwork to thrive. **Effective leaders**:

* Bring chaos into order
* Communicate and listen
* Promote trust and safety
* Provide empathy and create motivation 
* Delegate and prioritize
* Celebrate team successes

When **influencing** team members, leaders take the following steps:

1.  Establish credibility
2.  Frame for common ground 
3.  Provide evidence 
4.  Connect emotionally

**Leaders** draw on several sources of power, including **organizational power** (role, information, network, reputation) and **personal power** (knowledge, expressiveness, history, character). 

# Project Closeout Form

A **Project Closeout Form** is a document that summarizes the project and its outcomes. 

The **purposes** of the Project Closeout Form are to:

*   Document the project's completion
*   Capture lessons learned
*   Identify any outstanding items
*   Provide a record of the project for future reference

The **elements** of a Project Closeout Form are:

1.  Executive Summary
2.  Key Accomplishments
3.  Lessons Learned
4.  Open Items
5.  Next Steps & Future Considerations
6.  Project Timeline
7.  Resources & Project Archive
