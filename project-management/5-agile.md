# Fundamentals of Agile

## History & Values of Agile

**Agile** is a **flexible and iterative** process that prioritizes **user feedback** to deliver what the user wants and avoid waste. In contrast, the traditional **Waterfall** method is **sequential**, focusing on detailed requirements, documentation, change control, and bigger deliverables. Agile processes aim for more flexible and smaller releases.

General idea: get feedback -> build what the user wants -> avoid waste

## Agile Manifesto
The **Agile Manifesto**, created in 2001, outlines **four values and twelve principles**.

### Agile Values

*   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools. 
*   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
*   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
*   **Responding to change** over following a plan. 

### Agile Principles

The Agile Manifesto outlines **twelve principles** that guide Agile methodologies:

**Value Delivery:**

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
5. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

**Business Collaboration:**

1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
2. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

**Team Dynamics and Culture:**

1. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
2. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
3. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
4. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

**Continuous Learning:**

1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### VUCA

VUCA refers to conditions that affect or are a danger to the project model. It stands for:

*   **V** - **Volatile**: High rate of change and churn.
*   **U** - **Uncertain**: Lack of predictability, high surprise factor.
*   **C** - **Complex**: High number of interrelating forces.
*   **A** - **Ambiguous**: Possibility of misunderstanding.

Examining the project environment for these factors is important.  A **high VUCA environment suggests using an Agile model** while a low VUCA environment may be better suited for a Waterfall model. 

## Agile Frameworks

*   **Scrum**: This framework emphasizes daily meetings and utilizes a "backlog" as a central artifact for managing tasks. Sprints in Scrum typically last 1-4 weeks, ideally 2 weeks, with daily meetings (standups) of 15 minutes. Scrum utilizes a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development team.
*   **Kanban**: Kanban Board + this framework uses work-in-progress limits to improve efficiency. 
*   **XP (Extreme Programming)**: This method utilizes writing tests instead of detailed requirements.
*   **Lean**: This method focuses on mapping the value stream to determine what the customer wants, then creating a value stream map to remove wasted steps. It also works to improve the flow of products through steps to increase efficiency, establishing a "pull" where the customer asking for the product drives production, and pursuing perfection by iteratively improving upon the first three steps.

# Scrum
Scrum emphasizes **short cycles of development called sprints**. Each sprint produces a potentially shippable increment of the product, allowing for **frequent inspection and adaptation based on feedback and changing requirements**. This iterative approach allows the team to learn and improve throughout the project, ultimately delivering a product that better meets customer needs.

## Pillars of Scrum

**The three pillars of Scrum** underpin this iterative process:

*   **Transparency:** All aspects of the work are visible to everyone involved, including stakeholders, fostering trust and shared understanding.
*   **Inspection:** Regular checks are conducted on the product and the process to identify any deviations or areas for improvement. This includes activities like daily scrums, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
*   **Adaptation:** Based on the insights gained during inspection, the team continuously adapts its process, product backlog, and plans to optimize performance and deliver maximum value.

## Values of Scrum

**The five Scrum values** provide the foundation for effective teamwork and collaboration:

*   **Commitment:** The team commits to achieving the sprint goals and supporting each other.
*   **Courage:** Team members have the courage to speak up, share their ideas, and challenge the status quo.
*   **Focus:** The team concentrates on the sprint goals and avoids distractions.
*   **Openness:** Everyone is open to feedback, different perspectives, and new ideas.
*   **Respect:** Team members respect each other's skills, experiences, and opinions. 

## Scrum Roles

Three primary **Scrum roles**:

*   **Product Owner:** This role is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The Product Owner defines the product vision, manages the product backlog, prioritizes items, and ensures the team is building the right product. This role is considered a stakeholder, but external to the Scrum Team.

*   **Scrum Master:**  The Scrum Master acts as a servant leader, guiding and supporting the team in following the Scrum process. They remove impediments, facilitate meetings, and coach the team members on Scrum principles and practices. They are also responsible for protecting the team from external distractions and ensuring a productive working environment. This role is part of the Scrum team, but not considered a manager.

*   **Development Team**: This cross-functional team comprises individuals with the necessary skills to design, develop, test, and deliver the product increments. The Development Team is self-organizing and responsible for determining how to best complete the work assigned to them.

# Implementing Scrum

## Product Backlog

The **Product Backlog** is the **single source of truth for the Scrum team**.  It is a **living artifact** that evolves throughout the project as the team learns more about the product and customer needs. The Product Owner is responsible for creating and maintaining the Product Backlog.

The Product Backlog is characterized as follows:

*   A **single, living artifact** that outlines what the team is working on.
*   **Owned by the Product Owner**.
*   **Always prioritized** to ensure the team focuses on delivering the most valuable items first.

Each item in the Product Backlog, known as a **Backlog Item**, typically includes:

*   A **Description** of the desired functionality or feature.
*   The **Value** it delivers to the customer or business.
*   An **Estimate** of the effort required to complete it.

## User Stories

User Stories are a common format for expressing Backlog Items. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the user.

A well-defined User Story typically follows this structure:

*   **"As a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;action&gt;, so that &lt;benefit&gt;"**

To ensure User Stories are clear, concise, and valuable, they should adhere to the **INVEST criteria**:

*   **Independent**:  User Stories should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.
*   **Negotiable**: The details of a User Story can be discussed and refined with the team and stakeholders.
*   **Valuable**: Each User Story should deliver tangible value to the user or business.
*   **Estimable**: The team should be able to estimate the effort required to complete the story.
*   **Small**: User Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. Ideally, only one user story is tackled per sprint.
*   **Testable**:  The story should be testable to ensure it meets the defined acceptance criteria.

An **Epic** is a larger User Story that can be broken down into multiple smaller User Stories.

## Backlog Refinement

Backlog Refinement is an ongoing process of reviewing, updating, and refining the Product Backlog. This activity ensures the backlog remains relevant, prioritized, and detailed enough for the team to work with effectively.

Key activities during Backlog Refinement include:

*   **Adding new items** based on feedback, market trends, or changes in business requirements.
*   **Updating existing items** with more details, acceptance criteria, or estimates as the team gains more understanding.
*   **Breaking down large items** (Epics) into smaller, more manageable User Stories.
*   **Estimating the effort** required for each item.
*   **Prioritizing the backlog** based on value, risk, and dependencies.

Estimation during Backlog Refinement often employs techniques like:

*   **Story Points**: A relative measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty, typically using a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...). Higher uncertainty corresponds with higher risk. 
*   **T-shirt Sizes**: A simpler estimation technique using relative sizes (S, M, L, XL) to categorize the effort required for each item.

**Planning Poker** is a collaborative estimation technique where team members anonymously estimate the effort for each item and then discuss discrepancies to reach a consensus.

## Scrum Events

Scrum employs a set of defined events to structure the development process and ensure regular inspection and adaptation. 

These **Scrum Events** include:

*   **Sprint**: The heart of Scrum, a time-boxed iteration of 1-4 weeks (ideally 2 weeks) where a potentially shippable increment of the product is developed. The length of the sprint depends on the team's velocity.
*   **Sprint Planning**:  A collaborative meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the team selects items from the Product Backlog, defines the Sprint Goal, and creates a plan for delivering the selected items.
*   **Daily Scrum**: A short, daily meeting (15 minutes, also known as a standup) where team members synchronize their work, discuss progress, and identify any impediments.
*   **Sprint Review**:  A meeting at the end of each sprint where the team demonstrates the increment to stakeholders, gathers feedback, and discusses the next steps.
*   **Retrospective**: A meeting after the Sprint Review where the team reflects on the sprint, identifies areas for improvement, and creates an action plan to enhance their process and performance.

### Sprint
During a Sprint:

*   No changes are allowed that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
*   The quality of the product should not decrease.
*   The Backlog is not refined as a needed.
*   The scope of work may be renegotiated with the Product Owner, if necessary.

To track progress and ensure alignment during the sprint, the team defines a **Definition of Done**, outlining the criteria for completing a User Story or Backlog Item.

### Daily Scrum 

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute meeting, also known as a "standup". By default, it is a daily meeting, but it can be adjusted as needed. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to unblock any impediments to progress. Team members answer the following questions:

* What did I do yesterday? 
* What will I do today? 
* Do I notice any impediment?

### Sprint Review 

The Sprint Review is a product review meeting held at the end of a sprint. The purpose of the Sprint Review is to see what has been accomplished and what remains to be done. It provides: 

* Immediate feedback 
* Better collaboration

Concepts:
*   **Increment**: The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
*   **Release**: Potentially shippable increments, combined together, from the Product Backlog or multiple Sprints.
*   **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product. This is the version of a product with just enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. This version maximizes potential learning with minimal effort.

### Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held at the end of a sprint to discuss how the sprint went and how to improve future sprints. 

* The meeting can last up to three hours. 
* It is important that the meeting is blameless. 
* All team members should participate. 
* The team should discuss both the positive and negative aspects of the sprint. 
* Most importantly, the team should **"act on it!"**. 

### Burndown Chart & Velocity

**Burndown charts show the projected versus the actual progress of a sprint**.  **Velocity is the throughput of story points completed during a sprint**. Velocity is based on at least 3 sprints. Burndown charts and velocity help teams understand:

* How long it will take to complete the entire backlog
* How much of the backlog will be completed by a specific date 

# Applying Agile in an Organization

## Value-driven Delivery

**Processes in Agile are used in the service of creating product value.** The focus is on: 
- "building the right thing," 
- "building the thing right," and 
- "running it right." 

Teams should ask, "What does the customer want?" in order to understand the project goals, individual needs, and expectations.  Teams should "build only what is needed."  They should also carefully consider how users will interact with the product once it is delivered.

## Value Roadmap

**A value roadmap helps teams determine where to go and how to get there.**  A roadmap where to go, how to get there, outlines what to accomplish along the way, explains the vision of the product, and identifies milestones.  The components of a value roadmap include:

*   **Product vision:** Discovered through customer research, the product vision helps determine why the product is necessary, how it will support customers, and who will use it. Serves as a north star:
    *   What the product is
    *   How it supports the customer
    *   Who will use it
*   **Product roadmap:** This component provides a high-level overview of product requirements and a schedule for reaching milestones.
*   **Release plan:** The release plan includes the release goals, lists of backlog items, and release dates. 

## Influence

**To influence people, start by clarifying measurable results.** By using the **SMART** goals method, teams can define results that are **s**pecific, **m**easurable, **a**ttainable, **r**elevant, and **t**ime-bound.  Identifying critical actions needed to enact change can also be helpful. 

Leverage **six sources of influence**, which include personal motivation, personal ability, social motivation, social ability, structural motivation, and structural ability.

Here are some negotiation techniques for influencing people:

*   Ask open-ended questions instead of saying "no." For example, "How can we solve this problem?" 
*   Focus on interests, not positions.
*   Present mutually beneficial options.
*   Insist on objective criteria.

## Unstable Roadmap

**An unstable roadmap occurs when there is an overly ambitious product or too many product assumptions.**  This leads to creating documents instead of having discussions, and inhibiting feedback.
